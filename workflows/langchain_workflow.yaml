# Mapping of high-level roles to tool / chain names for LangChain-style orchestration.
# This is a lightweight, declarative mapping used by the orchestrator skeleton to
# wire role -> implementation. Implementations may be local stubs or real chains.

roles:
  orchestrator: "orchestrator_chain"
  criteria_validator: "criteria_validator_chain"
  scoring: "scoring_chain"
  implementer: "implementer_chain"
  synthesizer: "synthesizer_chain"
  validator: "validator_chain"
  recorder: "recorder_chain"

# Tool endpoints or local entrypoints (optional). For dry-run, these are informational.
