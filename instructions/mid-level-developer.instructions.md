# Mid-Level Developer Guidance

## Architecture-Focused Development
- Request design pattern implementations with trade-off explanations
- Ask for scalable solutions that can handle enterprise-level load
- Generate code that follows SOLID principles with architectural reasoning
- Request performance optimization suggestions for existing code

## Advanced Prompt Patterns
- "Refactor this code to improve maintainability while preserving functionality"
- "Generate a caching strategy for this data access pattern"
- "Optimize this query for better performance in enterprise scenarios"
- "Implement this feature using clean architecture principles"

## Integration and API Development
- Generate robust API endpoints with comprehensive error handling
- Request integration patterns for external services with retry logic
- Ask for database optimization strategies and query performance tuning
- Generate middleware components for cross-cutting concerns

## Security and Compliance Focus
- Request security architecture reviews for complex features
- Generate compliance documentation for audit requirements
- Ask for threat modeling considerations in code design
- Request secure integration patterns for third-party services

## Code Quality and Maintenance
- Generate comprehensive integration tests for complex workflows
- Request code metrics and quality assessments
- Ask for refactoring suggestions to reduce technical debt
- Generate documentation for complex business logic and algorithms
