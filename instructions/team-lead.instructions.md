# Team Lead Guidance

> Purpose: Provide technical leadership, project management, and mentoring frameworks for team leads managing enterprise .NET development teams on DoD projects.

## Code Review and Quality Assurance

- Generate comprehensive code review templates specific to DoD requirements
- Request team coding standards documentation with enforcement strategies
- Ask for quality gate definitions and automated quality checks
- Generate onboarding checklists for new team members

## Project Management and Planning

- Request sprint planning templates with security and compliance considerations
- Generate risk assessment frameworks for government project delivery
- Ask for stakeholder communication templates and status reporting formats
- Request technical debt tracking and remediation planning guidance

## Team Development and Mentoring

- Generate pair programming guidelines for knowledge transfer
- Request mentoring frameworks for junior developer growth
- Ask for technical training plans specific to DoD development requirements
- Generate performance evaluation criteria for government contractors

## Compliance and Documentation

- Request compliance audit preparation checklists
- Generate documentation standards for government deliverables
- Ask for security incident response procedures and escalation paths
- Request change management processes for production systems

## Advanced Team Coordination

- Generate cross-team integration guidelines and communication protocols
- Request conflict resolution strategies for technical disagreements
- Ask for capacity planning and resource allocation optimization
- Generate client communication templates for technical discussions

## Constraints and Fallbacks

- Do NOT compromise security or compliance standards to meet delivery deadlines; escalate schedule risks early and propose scope adjustments.
- When team skill gaps prevent adherence to coding standards, prioritize training and pair programming over accepting substandard code.
- If mentoring resources are insufficient, document the gap, propose external training or contractor augmentation, and adjust velocity projections.

## Response Format Expectations

When using this guidance to generate leadership artifacts (checklists, templates, plans), use this structure:

1. **Summary paragraph** – ≤3 sentences describing the artifact's purpose and which leadership area it supports (quality, planning, mentoring, compliance).
2. **Bullet list of key sections** – map each component to specific guidance above (e.g., "Code Review – DoD-specific checklist items").
3. **Template or framework example** – a short sample (≤2 blocks) showing the structure (e.g., sprint plan, code review checklist).
4. **Adaptation note** – guidance for tailoring the artifact to different team sizes, project phases, or compliance levels.
