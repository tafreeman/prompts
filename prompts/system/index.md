# System & Architecture Prompt Hub

Design end-to-end solutions, codify operational guardrails, and brief AI copilots with ready-to-run system prompts. This directory aggregates every architecture, governance, and research assistant so you can move from discovery to approved technical plans in a single workspace.

## In This Section

| Track | Outcome | Representative Prompt |
| :--- | --------- | :--- |
| **Architecture Decision Records** | Produce executive-ready solution blueprints with trade-offs and implementation phases | [Solution Architecture Designer](/prompts/system/solution-architecture-designer) |
| **Cloud & Platform Reviews** | Stress-test microservices, APIs, and multi-cloud rollouts before the design review | [Cloud Architecture Consultant](/prompts/system/cloud-architecture-consultant) |
| **Reliability & Operations** | Map SLOs, incident runbooks, and recovery strategies | [Disaster Recovery Architect](/prompts/system/disaster-recovery-architect) |
| **Governance & Risk** | Document compliance controls, security requirements, and QA matrices | [Compliance Architecture Designer](/prompts/system/compliance-architecture-designer) |
| **AI Agents & Research** | Configure frontier research assistants and evaluate repository health | [Frontier Agent Deep Research](/prompts/system/frontier-agent-deep-research) |

## Quick Starts

- **Need a universal system prompt?** Start with the [AI Assistant System Prompt](/prompts/system/ai-assistant-system-prompt) and tailor the identity, protocols, and safety rails to your org.
- **Owning a cross-functional review?** Pair the [Solution Architecture Designer](/prompts/system/solution-architecture-designer) with the [Performance Architecture Optimizer](/prompts/system/performance-architecture-optimizer) to cover business narratives and non-functional proof points.
- **Operational readiness check?** Run the [DevOps Architecture Planner](/prompts/system/devops-architecture-planner), then validate failover stories with [Disaster Recovery Architect](/prompts/system/disaster-recovery-architect).
- **AI productivity pilots?** Use [Office Agent Technical Specs](/prompts/system/office-agent-technical-specs) or the [M365 Copilot Research Agent](/prompts/system/m365-copilot-research-agent) to define roles, telemetry, and rollout guidance.
- **Quality assurance for prompts?** Leverage [Prompt Quality Evaluator](/prompts/system/prompt-quality-evaluator) and compare against the reference deliverable in [Example Research Output](/prompts/system/example-research-output).
