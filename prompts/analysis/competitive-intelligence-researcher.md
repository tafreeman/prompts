- **When time-limited:** Focus on 1-2 competitors deeply rather than 5+ superficially
- **For pricing analysis:** Use Wayback Machine to track historical pricing page changes
- **To validate findings:** Cross-reference 3+ independent sources before making strategic claims
- **For early warning signals:** Set up Google Alerts, RSS feeds, and social listening for competitors
- **When presenting to executives:** Lead with threats/opportunities, not methodology details
