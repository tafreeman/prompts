## Variables

- `[competitor_list]`: 2-5 competitors to research (e.g., "Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho CRM")
- `[focus_areas]`: Specific intelligence priorities (e.g., "Product roadmap analysis", "Pricing strategies", "Market expansion plans", "Technology stack evolution", "Key personnel changes")
- `[decision_context]`: What this research will inform (e.g., "2025 product roadmap prioritization", "Series B pitch deck competitive positioning", "Market entry strategy for EMEA")
- `[time_horizon]`: Research time scope (e.g., "Last 12 months", "Q1-Q3 2024", "Past 5 years for trend analysis")

## Tips

- **For product intelligence:** Monitor GitHub repos, technical blogs, and developer forums where engineers discuss upcoming features
- **When time-limited:** Focus on 1-2 competitors deeply rather than 5+ superficially
- **For pricing analysis:** Use Wayback Machine to track historical pricing page changes
- **To validate findings:** Cross-reference 3+ independent sources before making strategic claims
- **For early warning signals:** Set up Google Alerts, RSS feeds, and social listening for competitors
- **When presenting to executives:** Lead with threats/opportunities, not methodology details
