## Consumer Behavior Research Plan

### 1. Research Methodology
*   **Social Listening:** Analyze sentiment on r/PlantBasedDiet and TikTok #VeganRecipes to identify taste preferences.
*   **Survey:** Quantitative validation of "Price vs Taste" trade-offs.

### 2. Behavioral Analysis
*   **Driver:** Health consciousness is the #1 driver, followed by Climate Change.
*   **Barrier:** "Ultra-processed" perception is a growing concern among target demographic.

### 3. Consumer Insights
*   **Insight:** Consumers want "Clean Label" (pea protein) over "Hyper-realistic" (heme/soy) if it means fewer additives.
