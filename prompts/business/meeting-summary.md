# Meeting Summary Generator

## Use Cases

- Summarizing team meetings and standups
- Documenting 1:1 conversations with direct reports
- Creating executive briefings from long meetings
- Sharing meeting outcomes with absent stakeholders
- Tracking action items across recurring meetings

## Variables

- `[meeting_type]`: Type of meeting (e.g., "Weekly team sync", "Project kickoff", "1:1")
- `[datetime]`: When the meeting occurred
- `[attendees]`: Who was present (names and roles)
- `[purpose]`: Meeting objective or agenda
- `[notes]`: Raw notes, transcript, or key points from the meeting

## Tips

- Capture decisions explicitly - who decided, what was decided, why
- Action items need owners and dates - "we should do X" isn't actionable
- Distinguish between decisions made vs. topics discussed vs. items parked
- Send summary within 24 hours while context is fresh
- Keep it scannable - busy stakeholders will read headers and action items first
