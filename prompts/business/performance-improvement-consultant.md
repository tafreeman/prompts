## Performance Improvement Plan: Metro General ED

### Current State Diagnosis
| Metric | Current | Benchmark | Gap |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----|
| Average Wait Time | 4.5 hrs | 2.0 hrs | 2.5 hrs |
| Door-to-Doctor | 45 min | 20 min | 25 min |
| LWBS Rate | 8% | 2% | 6% |
| Patient Satisfaction | 62% | 85% | 23% |
| NPS | -12 | +30 | 42 pts |

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)
**Problem**: 4.5 hour average wait time
1. Why? Patients wait for beds after triage
2. Why? Admitted patients not moving to floors
3. Why? Floor beds not available until afternoon
4. Why? Discharge process starts late (after rounds)
5. Why? No proactive discharge planning

**Root Cause**: Lack of proactive discharge planning creates afternoon bed crunch

### Improvement Opportunities (Prioritized)
| Opportunity | Impact | Effort | Priority |
|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| Discharge by 11am initiative | High | Medium | ⭐ #1 |
| Fast-track for low-acuity | High | Low | ⭐ #2 |
| Provider in Triage | High | Medium | #3 |
| Real-time bed tracking | Medium | High | #4 |

### Action Plan
| Action | Owner | Timeline | Expected Impact |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|
| Implement Discharge by 11am | CNO | Week 1-4 | -1 hr wait time |
| Launch Fast-Track zone | ED Director | Week 2-6 | -30 min wait time |
| Provider in Triage pilot | Medical Director | Week 4-8 | -15 min door-to-doc |

### Quick Wins (0-30 Days)
1. **Hourly rounding updates** to waiting patients (satisfaction +10%)
2. **Visual wait time display** in waiting room (transparency)
3. **Charge nurse bed huddles** every 2 hours (flow awareness)

### Monitoring Framework
| KPI | Frequency | Target | Owner |
|-----|-----------|--------|-------|
| Average Wait Time | Daily | <2 hrs | ED Director |
| LWBS Rate | Daily | <3% | Charge Nurse |
| Patient Satisfaction | Weekly | >80% | Quality |
