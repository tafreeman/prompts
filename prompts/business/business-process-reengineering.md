# Business Process Reengineering

## Use Cases

- Redesigning order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, or quote-to-cash processes
- Streamlining manual, email-driven workflows into automated workflows
- Preparing before/after process views for executive decision-making
- Identifying where to introduce RPA, low-code, or workflow tools
- Standardizing process reengineering deliverables across consulting teams

## Variables

- `[process_name]`: Name of the business process to reengineer (e.g., "Quote-to-Cash for mid-market customers", "Procure-to-Pay for indirect spend")
- `[performance]`: Current process performance metrics (e.g., "Average cycle time 18 days; 12% rework rate")
- `[targets]`: Desired improvements (e.g., "Reduce cycle time to 6 days, cut rework to under 3%")
- `[constraints]`: Limitations to work within (e.g., "Existing ERP must remain; limited budget in year one")

## Tips

- Be specific when filling in placeholder values for better results
- Review and adjust the output to match your organization's standards
- Use this as a starting template and refine based on feedback
- For best results, provide relevant context and constraints
