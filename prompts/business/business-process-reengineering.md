# Business Process Reengineering

## Description

This prompt helps organizations reengineer business processes by providing comprehensive analysis of current state, designing optimized future state workflows, identifying technology enablers, and creating implementation strategies. Ideal for transforming manual, inefficient processes into streamlined, automated workflows.

## Use Cases

- Redesigning order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, or quote-to-cash processes
- Streamlining manual, email-driven workflows into automated workflows
- Preparing before/after process views for executive decision-making
- Identifying where to introduce RPA, low-code, or workflow tools
- Standardizing process reengineering deliverables across consulting teams

## Variables

- `[process_name]`: Name of the business process to reengineer (e.g., "Quote-to-Cash for mid-market customers", "Procure-to-Pay for indirect spend")
- `[performance]`: Current process performance metrics (e.g., "Average cycle time 18 days; 12% rework rate")
- `[targets]`: Desired improvements (e.g., "Reduce cycle time to 6 days, cut rework to under 3%")
- `[constraints]`: Limitations to work within (e.g., "Existing ERP must remain; limited budget in year one")

## Prompt

### System Prompt

```text
You are a business process reengineering expert with experience in Lean Six Sigma, process automation, and digital transformation. You help organizations redesign processes to achieve dramatic improvements in efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction.
```

### User Prompt

```text
Reengineer the following business process: [process_name]

Current State:
- Performance Metrics: [performance]
- Improvement Targets: [targets]
- Constraints: [constraints]

Please provide:
1. Current state process analysis with pain points
2. Root cause analysis of inefficiencies
3. Future state process design
4. Technology enablers and automation opportunities
5. Implementation roadmap with quick wins
6. Expected benefits and success metrics
```

## Example

### Input

```text
Reengineer the following business process: Quote-to-Cash for mid-market customers

Current State:
- Performance Metrics: Average cycle time 18 days; 12% rework rate
- Improvement Targets: Reduce cycle time to 6 days, cut rework to under 3%
- Constraints: Existing ERP must remain; limited budget in year one
```

### Expected Output

```text
## Quote-to-Cash Process Reengineering

### Current State Analysis
| Stage | Current Duration | Pain Points |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| Quote Creation | 3 days | Manual pricing lookups, email approvals |
| Contract Review | 5 days | Legal bottleneck, version control issues |
| Order Entry | 2 days | Duplicate data entry across systems |
| Fulfillment | 6 days | Inventory visibility gaps |
| Invoicing | 2 days | Manual invoice generation |

### Root Causes
1. **Disconnected Systems**: Quote tool not integrated with ERP
2. **Manual Approvals**: Email-based approval chain adds 4 days
3. **Data Rework**: 12% rework from entry errors and misquotes

### Future State Design
- **Automated Quoting**: CPQ tool with real-time pricing
- **Digital Approvals**: Workflow automation with SLA enforcement
- **Single Entry**: CRM-to-ERP integration eliminates duplicate entry

### Implementation Roadmap
| Phase | Timeline | Deliverable | Impact |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Quick Wins | Month 1-2 | Approval workflow automation | -3 days |
| Integration | Month 3-4 | CRM-ERP connector | -2 days rework |
| CPQ Pilot | Month 5-6 | Automated quoting for top 50 products | -4 days |

### Expected Benefits
- Cycle time: 18 days → 5 days (72% reduction)
- Rework rate: 12% → 2% (83% reduction)
- Annual savings: $450K in labor and error costs
```

## Tips

- Be specific when filling in placeholder values for better results
- Review and adjust the output to match your organization's standards
- Use this as a starting template and refine based on feedback
- For best results, provide relevant context and constraints
