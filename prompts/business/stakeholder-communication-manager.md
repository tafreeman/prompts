# Stakeholder Communication Manager

## Use Cases

- Quarterly executive board updates for technical transformation projects
- Change management communications for ERP/CRM migrations
- Crisis communication during service outages or project delays
- Multi-stakeholder alignment for cross-functional initiatives
- Vendor/partner relationship communication management

## Variables

- `[project_name]`: Project name and scope (e.g., "SAP S/4HANA Implementation - Finance & Supply Chain Modules")
- `[stakeholders]`: List of stakeholder groups with roles (e.g., "CFO (Sponsor), VP Supply Chain (Key User), IT Director, Warehouse Staff (End Users)")
- `[phase]`: Current project phase (e.g., "Blueprinting/Design", "UAT", "Go-Live", "Post-Production Support")
- `[challenges]`: Specific communication obstacles (e.g., "Resistance to change from warehouse staff, CFO demanding faster ROI visibility, offshore vendor language barriers")

## Tips

- **Tailor Messaging to Decision Authority**: Executives want ROI and risk; end users want "What's in it for me?" (WIIFM). Never use the same message for both audiences.
- **Use RACI to Clarify Ownership**: Ambiguous accountability kills stakeholder trust. Make it explicit who owns each communication stream.
- **Schedule Communication Cadence BEFORE Project Start**: Don't improvise. Lock in meeting rhythms (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) and publish a 6-month calendar.
- **Over-Communicate During Crisis**: If the project is at risk, triple your communication frequency. Silence breeds speculation and panic.
- **Measure Effectiveness, Not Just Activity**: Don't just track "emails sent." Track stakeholder satisfaction, survey scores, and "surprised by issue" incidents.
- **Leverage Asynchronous Tools for Offshore Teams**: Record Loom videos, use Miro for design reviews, and post meeting summaries in Confluence to bridge time zones.
- **Celebrate Wins Publicly**: Monthly pizza parties, shoutouts in newsletters, and "Contributor of the Month" awards build momentum and morale.
