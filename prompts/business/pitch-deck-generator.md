### Slide Detail

**Slide 2: Problem**
- Data teams spend 40% of time waiting for syncs or debugging failures
- Average sync latency is 15 minutes - unacceptable for real-time decisions
- Existing tools built for batch, not real-time world
- *Visual*: Clock showing wasted hours

**Slide 6: Traction**
| Metric | Value | Trend |
|--------|-------|-------|
| ARR | $2.1M | +30% MoM |
| Customers | 85 | +15 last quarter |
| NRR | 150% | Stable |
| Logo retention | 95% | Improving |
- *Visual*: ARR growth chart (hockey stick)

### Common Questions
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "Why now?" | Real-time analytics explosion, Fivetran's batch model can't keep up |
| "Why you?" | Team built Snowflake's data loading - we know this problem deeply |
| "Competition?" | We're 10x faster, verified by independent benchmarks |

### Appendix Slides
- Detailed financials and model
- Customer case studies (2-3)
- Technical architecture
- Competitive feature matrix
```

## Tips

- Lead with the problem, not your solution - investors invest in markets, not products
- Use concrete numbers wherever possible - "$2.1M ARR" beats "strong revenue growth"
- Keep slides visual - no more than 4 bullets, let speaker notes carry the story
- Practice the 10-minute version - most investor meetings run short on time
- Have backup slides ready for deep-dive questions on financials, competition, and tech
