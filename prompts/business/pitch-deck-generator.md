# Pitch Deck Generator

## Use Cases

- Startup fundraising presentations for seed/Series A rounds
- Sales team pitch decks for enterprise deals
- Internal business case presentations to leadership
- Product launch presentations to stakeholders
- Partnership proposal decks

## Variables

- `[company_name]`: Company or product name and brief description
- `[pitch_type]`: Type of pitch (e.g., "Series A fundraise", "Enterprise sales", "Partnership proposal")
- `[audience]`: Target audience (e.g., "VC investors at growth stage firms", "CTO buyers at Fortune 500")
- `[value_prop]`: Core value proposition in one sentence
- `[data_points]`: Key metrics, traction data, market research to include
- `[ask]`: What you're asking for (e.g., "$5M Series A at $25M pre-money", "Annual contract at $500K ARR")

## Tips

- Lead with the problem, not your solution - investors invest in markets, not products
- Use concrete numbers wherever possible - "$2.1M ARR" beats "strong revenue growth"
- Keep slides visual - no more than 4 bullets, let speaker notes carry the story
- Practice the 10-minute version - most investor meetings run short on time
- Have backup slides ready for deep-dive questions on financials, competition, and tech
