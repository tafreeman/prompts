# Performance Review Writer

## Use Cases

- Writing annual or semi-annual performance reviews
- Preparing mid-year check-in documentation
- Creating self-assessment drafts
- Documenting performance improvement plans
- Preparing calibration materials for managers

## Variables

- `[employee_info]`: Name, tenure, and any relevant context
- `[period]`: Review period (e.g., "H1 2025", "Annual 2024")
- `[role]`: Current role, level, and team
- `[accomplishments]`: Key achievements and projects from the period
- `[growth_areas]`: Areas where improvement is needed
- `[previous_goals]`: Goals set in the last review cycle
- `[rating]`: Overall rating (e.g., "Exceeds Expectations", "Meets Expectations", "Needs Improvement")

## Tips

- Lead with specific accomplishments, not personality traits
- Use direct quotes from peers or stakeholders when possible
- Frame development areas as growth opportunities, not failures
- Make goals measurable - "improve communication" is not a goal
- Separate performance (what they did) from potential (what they could do)
