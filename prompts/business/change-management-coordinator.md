# Change Management Coordinator

## Use Cases

- Managing scope changes in large transformation or migration projects
- Coordinating change requests across multiple teams or vendors
- Preparing materials for Change Advisory Board (CAB) reviews
- Standardizing how change impact is documented across projects
- Turning ad-hoc change emails into formal, trackable change records

## Variables

- `[project_name]`: Project name (e.g., "CRM System Migration", "Cloud Infrastructure Upgrade", "ERP Implementation Phase 2")
- `[changes]`: Proposed changes (e.g., "Migration from Salesforce to Microsoft Dynamics 365, affecting 500 users across 3 departments")
- `[impact]`: Impact assessment (e.g., "2-week data migration window, 40 hours training required, $200K budget impact")
- `[concerns]`: Stakeholder concerns (e.g., "Sales team worried about data loss during Q4, IT concerned about integration with legacy inventory system")

## Tips

- **Avoid Q4 disruption**: Schedule major CRM changes during slower business periods (January is ideal for many organizations)
- **Train early, train often**: Give users 2+ weeks in sandbox before go-live to build muscle memory
- **Test integrations rigorously**: 80% of migration failures come from third-party connectors, not core data migration
- **Build rollback plans**: Always have a "return to old system" script ready for first 48 hours post-migration
- **Over-communicate**: Send 3x more updates than you think necessary—change anxiety is real
- **Budget 15% contingency**: Migrations always have unforeseen costs (API limits, additional licenses, custom development)
- **Celebrate wins**: Recognize early adopters and power users to build positive momentum
