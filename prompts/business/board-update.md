# Board Update Generator

## Use Cases

- Monthly or quarterly board updates
- Investor email communications
- Pre-board meeting briefing documents
- Year-end shareholder letters
- Strategic update memos to stakeholders

## Variables

- `[company]`: Company name and brief context
- `[period]`: Reporting period (e.g., "November 2024", "Q3 2024")
- `[metrics]`: Key performance metrics and targets
- `[highlights]`: Major wins and accomplishments
- `[challenges]`: Issues, risks, and concerns
- `[asks]`: Decisions or input needed from the board
- `[audience]`: Board composition and any specific context

## Tips

- Lead with the headline: good news or bad news first, don't bury it
- Be honest about challenges - boards respect transparency over spin
- Make asks specific and actionable - "need help" isn't an ask
- Include context for metrics - numbers without narrative are confusing
- Keep it under 3 pages for monthly updates; save details for appendices
