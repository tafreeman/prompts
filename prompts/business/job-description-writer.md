## About FinFlow

FinFlow is building the future of B2B payments. We make it radically simple for businesses to send, receive, and manage payments—replacing the chaos of checks, ACH delays, and manual reconciliation with modern infrastructure.

We're a Series B company backed by Stripe, a]16z, and Ribbit Capital, with $50M raised and strong product-market fit (3x revenue growth last year). Our 80-person team is engineering-driven—we believe great products come from empowered engineers who own problems end-to-end.

**Why people love working here:**

- Real ownership: Engineers ship features to production in their first week
- Technical excellence: We invest heavily in developer experience and system reliability
- Growth stage: Big enough to have impact, small enough to shape the culture

## What We're Looking For

### Must-Have

- Strong backend engineering fundamentals—you can design systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable
- Experience with distributed systems (event-driven architectures, message queues, eventual consistency)
- Proficiency in Go, Python, or similar languages (we use Go primarily)
- Track record of shipping and operating production systems at scale
- Clear communication—you can explain complex technical concepts to engineers and non-engineers alike

### Nice-to-Have

- Experience in payments, fintech, or financial infrastructure
- Familiarity with compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, SOC 2)
- Background in platform/infrastructure engineering
- Experience mentoring or leading technical projects

*Note: We care about what you can do, not where you learned it. If you've built impressive things through non-traditional paths, we want to hear about it.*

**What to include:**

1. Application review (we respond within 5 business days)

3. 60-min technical conversation with hiring manager
4. Virtual onsite (3 hours): system design + coding + team conversations
