| --------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Display Name | ... | Name variations, nicknames |
| Username/Handle | ... | Cross-platform searching |

| Join Date | ... | Account age, authenticity |
| Verification | ... | Identity confirmation |

**Account Statistics:**

**Red Flag Indicators:**

- Inconsistent information across posts
- Unusual posting patterns (bot-like behavior)
- Engagement anomalies (fake followers)
- Contradictory claims over time

### Phase 3: Network Mapping

**Pattern Recognition:**

- Daily posting schedule → Timezone, routine
- Weekly patterns → Work/life balance

Link to other online presence:

**Discovery Methods:**

| Instagram | ... | ... | High/Med/Low |
| LinkedIn | ... | ... | High/Med/Low |
| GitHub | ... | ... | High/Med/Low |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Phase 6: Authenticity Assessment
Evaluate profile legitimacy:

**Authenticity Indicators:**
| Factor | Positive Signs | Negative Signs |
| -------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Account Age | Years old, consistent history | Very new, rapid growth |
| Content | Original, personal, varied | Stock photos, generic |
