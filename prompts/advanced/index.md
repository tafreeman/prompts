Tackle ambiguous research briefs, multi-step diagnostics, and large knowledge bases with proven reasoning blueprints. This directory curates every high-complexity workflow in the library—perfect for architects, staff engineers, and AI platform owners who need reliable, repeatable thinking structures.

## In This Section

| Pattern | When to Use | Representative Prompt |
| :--- | ------------- | :--- |
| **Chain-of-Thought** | Step-by-step reasoning, debugging, performance analysis | [Detailed CoT](/prompts/advanced/chain-of-thought-detailed) |
| **Reflection & Self-Critique** | Improve answers using AI feedback loops | [Reflection Self-Critique](/prompts/advanced/reflection-self-critique) |
| **Tree-of-Thoughts** | Branching exploration, architecture trade-offs | [ToT Template](/prompts/advanced/tree-of-thoughts-template) |
| **RAG / Document Agents** | Summaries grounded in source material | [RAG Document Retrieval](/prompts/advanced/rag-document-retrieval) |
| **Agentic Workflows** | Tool-augmented research and diagnostics | [React Tool Augmented](/prompts/advanced/react-tool-augmented) |

## Quick Starts

- **New to advanced prompting?** Start with the [Chain-of-Thought Guide](/prompts/advanced/chain-of-thought-guide) for a tour of concise, debugging, and detailed modes.
- **Need grounded research?** Use [RAG Document Retrieval](/prompts/advanced/rag-document-retrieval) or [React Doc Search Synthesis](/prompts/advanced/react-doc-search-synthesis) to cite specific documents.
- **Design reviews?** [Tree-of-Thoughts Architecture Evaluator](/prompts/advanced/tree-of-thoughts-architecture-evaluator) walks through structured trade-off scoring.
