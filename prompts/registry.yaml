# yaml-language-server: $schema=.github/registry-schema.json
# =============================================================================
# Prompt Library Registry
# =============================================================================
# Central metadata registry for all prompts. Individual prompt files contain
# only minimal frontmatter (name, description). All discovery, categorization,
# governance, and platform metadata lives here.
#
# Benefits:
#   - Single source of truth for library metadata
#   - Easier bulk updates (platforms, governance, etc.)
#   - Simpler prompt files (2-3 fields vs 15+)
#   - Matches industry standard (Anthropic, OpenAI cookbooks)
#
# Required fields: title, path, categories, author, date
# Optional fields: description, platforms, audience, difficulty, technique,
#                  governance, tags, archived
