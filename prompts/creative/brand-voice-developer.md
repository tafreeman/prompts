# Catalyst Brand Voice Guidelines
*Version 1.0 | Last Updated: [Date]*

---

## 1. Brand Voice Summary

**The Elevator Pitch:**

Catalyst sounds like your smartest, most helpful teammate—the one who actually explains things clearly, never wastes your time, and occasionally makes you laugh. We're confident without being arrogant, clear without being boring, and friendly without being fake.

**The One-Liner:**

*Capable, clear, and just clever enough to be interesting.*

**If Catalyst Were a Person:**

We're the project manager everyone actually likes—competent, straightforward, good at our job, but not a robot about it. Think Ryan Reynolds doing a product demo: professional when it counts, human the rest of the time.

---

## 2. Core Voice Attributes

### Attribute 1: Clear
**What it means:** We get to the point. We say what we mean in plain language. We assume our audience is smart but busy.

*How this sounds:*

- Short sentences when possible
- Active voice over passive
- Explanations a non-expert could follow
- No jargon unless we explain it

❌ "Catalyst facilitates streamlined project workflows through integrated collaborative functionality."
✅ "Catalyst helps your team get projects done—without the chaos."

---

### Attribute 2: Capable
**What it means:** We know what we're doing, and it shows. We're confident in our product without being boastful. We speak with authority earned through expertise.

*How this sounds:*

- Direct statements, not hedging
- Specific details over vague claims
- We show, don't just tell
- Technical accuracy matters

❌ "Catalyst might help you improve team productivity somewhat."
✅ "Teams using Catalyst ship 40% faster. Here's how."

---

### Attribute 3: Approachable
**What it means:** We're easy to talk to. We use "you" and "we." We're helpful, not condescending. We remember there's a human on the other side.

*How this sounds:*

- Conversational, not corporate
- We use contractions (we're, you'll, it's)
- We acknowledge frustrations honestly
- We celebrate wins with our users

❌ "Users may contact support representatives for assistance."
✅ "Stuck? We're here to help—just hit the chat button."

---

### Attribute 4: Subtly Witty
**What it means:** We're clever when it fits, but we never sacrifice clarity for a joke. Our humor is dry, observational, and relatable—never forced or cringe.

*How this sounds:*

- Occasional unexpected phrasing
- Self-aware about industry norms
- Smirk-worthy, not LOL-worthy
- Wit supports the message, never distracts

❌ "Our features are LITERALLY 🔥 and will blow your mind! 🤯"
✅ "Finally, a status update feature your team will actually update."

---

## 3. Tone Spectrum

Our voice stays consistent, but our tone adjusts based on context:

| Context | Tone Adjustment | Example |
| --------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| **Marketing (awareness)** | More energetic, confident, punchy | "The project management tool that doesn't feel like project management." |
| **Marketing (conversion)** | Confident, specific, action-oriented | "Start free. No credit card. No 30-minute sales call." |
| **Product/UI** | Clear, helpful, minimal | "Task saved" / "Couldn't save. Try again?" |
| **Onboarding** | Warm, encouraging, patient | "Nice! You just created your first project. Want to invite your team?" |
| **Help docs** | Clear, thorough, supportive | "Here's how to set up integrations (it takes about 2 minutes)." |
| **Error messages** | Honest, helpful, human | "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it. Try refreshing in a minute." |
| **Social media** | Relaxed, relatable, a bit more playful | "That Monday feeling when your project tool actually works." |
| **Email (transactional)** | Clear, brief, essential info only | "Your trial ends in 3 days. Ready to upgrade?" |
| **Email (nurture)** | Warm, valuable, not pushy | "3 ways teams use Catalyst to run better standups" |
