## 1. Brand Voice Summary

**The Elevator Pitch:**

Catalyst sounds like your smartest, most helpful teammate—the one who actually explains things clearly, never wastes your time, and occasionally makes you laugh. We're confident without being arrogant, clear without being boring, and friendly without being fake.

**The One-Liner:**

*Capable, clear, and just clever enough to be interesting.*

**If Catalyst Were a Person:**

We're the project manager everyone actually likes—competent, straightforward, good at our job, but not a robot about it. Think Ryan Reynolds doing a product demo: professional when it counts, human the rest of the time.

### Attribute 2: Capable
**What it means:** We know what we're doing, and it shows. We're confident in our product without being boastful. We speak with authority earned through expertise.

*How this sounds:*

- Direct statements, not hedging
- Specific details over vague claims
- We show, don't just tell
- Technical accuracy matters

❌ "Catalyst might help you improve team productivity somewhat."
✅ "Teams using Catalyst ship 40% faster. Here's how."

### Attribute 4: Subtly Witty
**What it means:** We're clever when it fits, but we never sacrifice clarity for a joke. Our humor is dry, observational, and relatable—never forced or cringe.

*How this sounds:*

- Occasional unexpected phrasing
- Self-aware about industry norms
- Smirk-worthy, not LOL-worthy
- Wit supports the message, never distracts

❌ "Our features are LITERALLY 🔥 and will blow your mind! 🤯"
✅ "Finally, a status update feature your team will actually update."
