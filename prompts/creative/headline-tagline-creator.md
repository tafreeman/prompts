**Project Type:** Both headline and tagline
**Purpose:** Landing page for a new product launch
**Brand/Product:** FocusFlow - an AI-powered productivity app that blocks distracting websites and suggests optimal work schedules based on your energy patterns

- Must include: Reference to focus or distraction in at least half

## Tips

- **Write 20 to find 1:** The best headlines rarely come first—generate many options and let the strongest emerge
- **Test the "so what" test:** Read your headline and ask "so what?"—if there's not an immediate compelling answer, revise
- **Use power words strategically:** Words like "finally," "secret," "proven," "instant," and "free" work because they trigger emotional responses
- **Match the stage of awareness:** High-awareness audiences respond to direct offers; low-awareness audiences need curiosity hooks
- **Keep it speakable:** Great headlines sound natural when read aloud—avoid awkward phrasing that trips up the tongue
- **Consider the context:** A LinkedIn headline needs to feel different from a TikTok caption—platform voice matters
