🚀 The best product teams I've worked with have one thing in common:

They fail more than anyone else.

Here's the counterintuitive truth about building great products:

→ Teams that ship fast and fail small learn 10x faster
→ Teams that avoid failure at all costs move slowly and miss markets
→ The cost of a small failure is always less than the cost of a missed opportunity

I've seen this pattern across 50+ product launches:

✅ Companies that run 20 small experiments beat those running 2 "perfect" launches
✅ Quick iterations reveal customer needs faster than months of research
✅ Failed features often lead to breakthrough insights

The key isn't avoiding failure—it's failing strategically:

1. Make failures small and reversible
2. Set clear learning goals before each test
3. Share failures openly so the whole team learns
4. Celebrate the insight, not just the outcome

One team I advised reduced their product-market fit timeline from 18 months to 4 months by embracing weekly "failure reviews."

The question isn't "How do we avoid failing?"

It's "How do we fail faster and smarter?"

What's your experience with "failing fast"? 

Has embracing small failures helped your team? Or have you seen it backfire?

## Tips

- **Platform-specific formatting:** LinkedIn favors longer posts with line breaks, Twitter needs concise punchy content, Instagram focuses on visual captions, Facebook works best with questions and community engagement
- **Test different hooks:** The first line determines if people keep reading—try questions, bold statements, or surprising facts
- **Use the 80/20 rule:** 80% value-giving content, 20% promotional or CTA-focused
- **Engagement timing matters:** Ask for specific feedback ("What's your experience with X?") rather than generic engagement ("Thoughts?")
- **Repurpose strategically:** One piece of content can become multiple platform-specific posts with different angles
