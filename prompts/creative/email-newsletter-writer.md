## 🤖 AI Coding Assistants: The Honest Comparison

I spent last week putting GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cody, and Amazon CodeWhisperer through real-world tests. Not synthetic benchmarks—actual coding tasks from my daily work.

**The quick verdict:**

| Tool | Best For | Watch Out For |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| **Copilot** | Inline completions, familiar codebases | Can be chatty, context limits |
| **Cursor** | Refactoring, codebase-wide changes | Learning curve, resource usage |
| **Cody** | Open source, privacy-conscious teams | Newer, smaller community |
| **CodeWhisperer** | AWS-heavy projects, free tier | AWS ecosystem focus |

**My pick for most developers:** Start with Copilot, add Cursor for big refactors.

## 🌟 Community Spotlight

**Project of the Week: `lazygit`**

If you're not using a TUI for git, you're missing out. `lazygit` makes complex git operations visual and fast.

Why I love it:

- Interactive rebase without memorizing commands
- Cherry-pick commits with arrow keys
- Resolve merge conflicts visually

## Tips

- **Subject lines are everything:** Test multiple versions—even a 5% improvement in open rates compounds over time
- **Preview text is your second headline:** Don't waste it on "View in browser" or let it auto-fill with unsubscribe text
- **Front-load value:** Put your best content in the first section—many readers only skim
- **One primary CTA:** Having multiple competing actions reduces clicks on all of them
- **The P.S. gets read:** It's one of the most-read parts of any email—use it strategically
- **Personalization beyond [First Name]:** Reference subscriber behavior, segments, or interests when possible
