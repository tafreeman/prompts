## Tips

- **Lead with benefits, not features:** "Sleep better on flights" beats "Memory foam construction"—always translate features into customer outcomes
- **Use sensory language:** Help customers imagine owning the product with words they can see, feel, and experience
- **Address objections proactively:** If customers might worry about size, durability, or price, address it before they object
- **Match platform conventions:** Amazon shoppers scan bullets; Etsy shoppers read stories—adapt your format accordingly
- **Include social proof naturally:** Numbers and credentials build trust without sounding salesy
- **Test multiple versions:** Small changes in headlines and opening lines can significantly impact conversion rates
