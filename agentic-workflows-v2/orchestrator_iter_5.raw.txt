[INST] As the Implementation Orchestrator for the iteration 5 of the agentic-workflows-v2 package, I understand the task list provided and the iteration 5 task IDs. I will now create a task list for iteration 5 with tasks broken down into 3-5 concrete tasks focusing on foundational work first (pyproject.toml, package structure, core contracts).

The task list will follow the provided rules and will be in the required JSON format. Here is the task list for iteration 5:
