r"""Core protocols — engine-agnostic interfaces for the workflow system.

Defines the structural subtyping contracts (PEP 544) that all execution
engines, agents, tools, and memory stores must satisfy.  Uses
``typing.Protocol`` so existing classes conform implicitly by shape
without inheriting from these types.

Why Protocol over ABC:
- **Structural subtyping** — conformance checked by shape, not lineage.
- **No runtime cost** — erased at runtime; no ``super().__init__()`` needed.
- **Gradual adoption** — opt-in ``runtime_checkable`` verification.

Type-safety notes (Sprint C1):
- ``ctx`` parameters are typed as ``Optional[ExecutionContext]`` — every
  known implementation accepts this type.
- ``ExecutionEngine.execute()`` returns ``WorkflowResult`` — verified
  across DAGExecutor, PipelineExecutor, WorkflowExecutor, NativeEngine,
  and LangChainEngine.
- ``workflow`` remains ``Any`` because different engines accept different
  representations (``DAG``, ``Pipeline``, ``str``, etc.).
- ``AgentProtocol.run()`` keeps ``input_data: Any`` and return ``Any``
  to preserve structural subtyping for duck-typed implementations.
  Concrete agents use bounded ``TypeVar``\s (``TInput``, ``TOutput``)
  defined in ``agents.base``.
- Imports guarded by ``TYPE_CHECKING`` to prevent circular imports
  (``core/`` <- ``engine/`` <- ``core/``).
