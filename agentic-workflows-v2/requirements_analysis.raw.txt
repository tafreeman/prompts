  "summary": "We're building a standalone Python package for tiered multi-model AI workflows that routes tasks to appropriate model sizes - small models for simple tasks, large models for complex reasoning. The system includes adaptive routing with failure tracking and automatic fallback, built on Pydantic contracts and async execution patterns. It's a clean-slate implementation independent from existing workflows.",
  "key_requirements": [
    "Standalone package with pyproject.toml using Hatchling and Python >=3.11",
    "SmartModelRouter with 4-tier routing (0-3) and adaptive learning/failure tracking",
    "Pydantic v2 contracts for all agent inputs/outputs and inter-agent messages",
    "Async BaseAgent interface with uniform execute() method and StepContext",
    "Built-in tier-0 tools (file operations, JSON transforms, templates) requiring no LLM",
    "Tool registry with auto-discovery from agentic_v2.tools.builtin package",
    "Execution patterns: sequential, parallel, iterative, self-refinement",
    "State management with checkpointing for workflow persistence",
    "Evaluation framework with YAML rubrics and JSON/Markdown reporters",
    "Typer CLI with run, list, validate commands and workflow resumption"
  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Python >=3.11 required (no legacy version support)",
    "Minimal dependencies: Pydantic, httpx, Jinja2, jmespath only",
    "Zero modifications to existing multiagent-workflows/ codebase",
    "Can import read-only from tools/llm/llm_client.py but not modify",
    "All file operations in tests must use temporary directories",
    "≥80% line coverage with tier-based test markers (@pytest.mark.tier0, etc.)",
    "No heavy frameworks: LangChain, Haystack, or similar abstractions",
    "Strict Pydantic validation with extra='forbid' on all contracts"
