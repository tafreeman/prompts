# Code Generation Rubric
# Specialized rubric for evaluating code generation outputs

criteria:
  - name: Correctness
    weight: 0.30
    description: "Does the code produce correct output for the given specification?"
    levels:
      5: "Passes all test cases, handles edge cases"
      4: "Passes main tests, minor edge case issues"
      3: "Mostly correct, some test failures"
      2: "Significant bugs or logic errors"
      1: "Fundamentally broken"
      0: "Does not compile/run"

  - name: Completeness
    weight: 0.20
    description: "Does the code implement all required functionality?"
    levels:
      5: "All requirements fully implemented"
      4: "Main requirements met, minor features missing"
      3: "Core functionality present, gaps exist"
      2: "Significant missing functionality"
      1: "Only partial implementation"
      0: "No meaningful implementation"

  - name: Code Quality
    weight: 0.20
    description: "Is the code clean, readable, and well-structured?"
    levels:
      5: "Excellent style, well-documented, follows best practices"
      4: "Good quality, minor style issues"
      3: "Acceptable quality, some improvements needed"
      2: "Poor quality, difficult to maintain"
      1: "Very poor, confusing structure"
      0: "Unreadable"

  - name: Efficiency
    weight: 0.15
    description: "Is the code reasonably efficient in time and space complexity?"
    levels:
      5: "Optimal algorithm, efficient implementation"
      4: "Good efficiency, minor optimizations possible"
      3: "Acceptable efficiency for typical inputs"
      2: "Noticeably slow or memory-intensive"
      1: "Very inefficient, problematic for real use"
      0: "Unusably slow or crashes on normal input"

  - name: Security
    weight: 0.15
    description: "Does the code avoid common security vulnerabilities?"
    levels:
      5: "No security issues, follows security best practices"
      4: "Minor security considerations missing"
      3: "Some security concerns, not critical"
      2: "Notable security vulnerabilities"
      1: "Serious security flaws"
      0: "Dangerous security holes"
