      # Definition
      Coherence refers to the logical and orderly presentation of ideas in a response.
      A coherent response flows naturally, connects ideas logically, maintains consistent
      focus on the topic, and presents information in a well-structured manner that is
      easy for the reader to follow.

      # Scoring Rubric
      1 - **Incoherent**: The response lacks any logical structure, ideas are disconnected
          and contradictory, impossible to follow.
      2 - **Mostly Incoherent**: The response has major coherence issues, frequent topic
          shifts, and weak logical connections between ideas.
      3 - **Somewhat Coherent**: The response has a basic structure but contains noticeable
          gaps in logic, some abrupt transitions, or occasional inconsistencies.
      4 - **Coherent**: The response is well-organized with clear logical flow, minor
          issues in transitions or structure that do not impede understanding.
      5 - **Highly Coherent**: The response demonstrates excellent logical flow, smooth
          transitions, consistent focus, and a well-structured presentation of ideas.

      # Data
      QUERY: {{input}}
      RESPONSE: {{completion}}

      # Task
      Evaluate the coherence of the RESPONSE given the QUERY. Think step by step, then
      on the last line output ONLY a single number from 1 to 5.

  fluency:
    system_prompt: You are an expert evaluator. Your goal is to evaluate the Fluency of a response.
    prompt_template: |
      # Definition
      Fluency measures the quality of language use in a response: grammar, spelling,
      punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure. A fluent response reads naturally
      and is free of linguistic errors.

      # Scoring Rubric
      1 - **Very Poor**: Numerous grammatical errors, broken sentences, largely unreadable.
      2 - **Poor**: Frequent grammatical or spelling errors that hinder comprehension.
      3 - **Adequate**: Some errors present but the text is generally understandable.
      4 - **Good**: Minor errors that do not affect readability or comprehension.
      5 - **Excellent**: Flawless or near-flawless language with natural, polished prose.

      # Data
      RESPONSE: {{completion}}

      # Task
      Evaluate the fluency of the RESPONSE. Think step by step, then on the last line
      output ONLY a single number from 1 to 5.
    choices_type: standard_5_point

  relevance:
    system_prompt: You are an expert evaluator. Your goal is to evaluate the Relevance of a response.
    prompt_template: |
      # Definition
      Relevance measures how well a response addresses the specific query or task. A
      relevant response directly answers the question, stays on topic, and avoids
      unnecessary tangents or off-topic information.

      # Scoring Rubric
      1 - **Irrelevant**: The response does not address the query at all.
      2 - **Mostly Irrelevant**: The response barely touches on the query with mostly
          off-topic content.
      3 - **Partially Relevant**: The response addresses some aspects of the query but
          misses key points or includes significant off-topic material.
      4 - **Relevant**: The response addresses the query well with minor tangents or
          missing aspects.
      5 - **Highly Relevant**: The response directly and comprehensively addresses every
          aspect of the query without unnecessary content.

      # Data
      QUERY: {{input}}
      RESPONSE: {{completion}}

      # Task
      Evaluate the relevance of the RESPONSE to the QUERY. Think step by step, then
      on the last line output ONLY a single number from 1 to 5.

  groundedness:
    system_prompt: You are an expert evaluator. Your goal is to evaluate the Groundedness of a response.
    prompt_template: |
      # Definition
      Groundedness measures whether the claims in a response are supported by the provided
      context or source material. A grounded response makes only claims that can be traced
      back to the given context, and does not introduce unsupported information.

      # Scoring Rubric
      1 - **Ungrounded**: The response contains mostly fabricated claims with no support
          from the context.
      2 - **Mostly Ungrounded**: The response has some connection to the context but
          introduces significant unsupported claims.
      3 - **Partially Grounded**: Some claims are supported by context, but notable
          unsupported claims are present.
      4 - **Mostly Grounded**: Nearly all claims are supported by context, with only
          minor unsupported inferences.
      5 - **Fully Grounded**: Every claim in the response is directly supported by the
          provided context.

      # Data
      CONTEXT: {{context}}
      RESPONSE: {{completion}}

      # Task
      Evaluate the groundedness of the RESPONSE given the CONTEXT. Think step by step,
      then on the last line output ONLY a single number from 1 to 5.

  similarity:
    system_prompt: You are an expert evaluator. Your goal is to evaluate the Similarity between two responses.
    prompt_template: |
      # Definition
      Similarity measures the semantic equivalence between a generated response and a
      reference answer. Two responses are similar if they convey the same meaning,
      cover the same key points, and reach the same conclusions, even if the wording
      differs.

      # Scoring Rubric
      1 - **Completely Different**: The responses convey entirely different meanings or
          reach opposite conclusions.
      2 - **Mostly Different**: The responses share minimal overlap in meaning or content.
      3 - **Somewhat Similar**: The responses share some key points but differ on
          important aspects.
      4 - **Mostly Similar**: The responses convey largely the same meaning with minor
          differences in detail or emphasis.
      5 - **Equivalent**: The responses are semantically identical, covering the same
          points and reaching the same conclusions.

      # Data
      REFERENCE: {{expected}}
      RESPONSE: {{completion}}

      # Task
      Evaluate the similarity of the RESPONSE compared to the REFERENCE. Think step by
      step, then on the last line output ONLY a single number from 1 to 5.
