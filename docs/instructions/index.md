# Custom Instructions & Personas

Define how your AI assistant should behave, code, and communicate. These instructions can be added to your user settings or repository configuration to enforce standards and adopt specific personas.

## In This Section

| Instruction | Focus | Best For |
| ------------- | ------- | ---------- |
| **[Senior Developer](/instructions/senior-developer.instructions)** | Best Practices | High-quality, maintainable code generation |
| **[C# Standards](/instructions/csharp-standards.instructions)** | Language Rules | Enforcing .NET coding conventions |
| **[Security Compliance](/instructions/security-compliance.instructions)** | Safety | Ensuring secure coding patterns |
| **[Team Lead](/instructions/team-lead.instructions)** | Mentorship | Code reviews and architectural guidance |

## Quick Starts

- **Want better code?** Add [Senior Developer](/instructions/senior-developer.instructions) instructions to your custom instructions.
- **Working in .NET?** Combine [C# Standards](/instructions/csharp-standards.instructions) and [Razor Standards](/instructions/razor-standards.instructions) for a full stack setup.
- **Focusing on security?** Use [Security Compliance](/instructions/security-compliance.instructions) and [SQL Security](/instructions/sql-security.instructions) to harden your outputs.
