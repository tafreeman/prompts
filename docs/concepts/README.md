## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

Our approach to teaching concepts:

1. **Start with "Why"**: Explain the purpose before the mechanics
2. **Use Analogies**: Connect to familiar programming concepts
3. **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Include concrete examples
4. **Layer Complexity**: Begin simple, add nuance progressively
5. **Link to Practice**: Connect theory to practical application

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to read all concept docs before using prompts?**  
A: No. Start with [Your First Prompt](../tutorials/first-prompt.md) tutorial, then return to concepts as needed for deeper understanding.

**Q: Are these concepts applicable to all AI models?**  
A: Most concepts are universal, but [Model Capabilities](model-capabilities.md) explains model-specific differences.

**Q: How often are concepts updated?**  
A: Quarterly reviews ensure accuracy. See [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md) for updates.

**Q: Can I use these for team training?**  
A: Absolutely! These documents are designed for self-study and team workshops.
