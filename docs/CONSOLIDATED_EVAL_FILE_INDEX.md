# Consolidated Evaluation & Scoring File Index

This index lists files in the repository that are related to prompt evaluation and scoring (research, methodology, tools, eval cases, results, tests, and prompts that implement evaluators). Use this table as the canonical inventory when designing a standalone PromptEval tool.
