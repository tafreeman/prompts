# Incident Response Prompt Bundle (Initial Skeleton)

This bundle groups prompts and workflows that support **incident response** in technical and business contexts.

> **Status:** Skeleton for planning. Replace placeholders with concrete links and refine over time.

## 1. Detection & Triage

- [ ] Incident Response Playbook (docs/workflows/incident-response-playbook.md)
- [ ] Metrics and KPI Designer (analysis)
- [ ] Process Optimization Consultant (analysis)

## 2. Technical Investigation

- [ ] Security Code Auditor (developers)
- [ ] Performance Optimization Specialist (developers)
- [ ] Data Analysis & Insights (analysis)

## 3. Communication & Stakeholder Management

- [ ] Crisis Management Coordinator (business)
- [ ] Client Presentation Designer (business)

## 4. Containment & Remediation

- [ ] DevOps Pipeline Architect (developers)
- [ ] Legacy System Modernization (developers)

## 5. Post-Incident Review & Learning

- [ ] Tree-of-Thoughts Template for multi-branch root-cause analysis (advanced-techniques/tree-of-thoughts-template.md)
- [ ] Reflection / Self-Critique (advanced-techniques/reflection-self-critique.md)

## Usage

1. During an incident, start with **Detection & Triage** and move downward.
2. Use advanced techniques (CoT, ToT, Reflection) for complex investigations and postmortems.
3. After the incident, capture effective prompt configurations for reuse.

Over time, this bundle should be refined with:
- Concrete links to prompt files
- Example incident scenarios and filled-in prompts
- Integration notes for ticketing and monitoring systems.
