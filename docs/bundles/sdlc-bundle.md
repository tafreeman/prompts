## Usage

1. Start at the lifecycle stage you are working on.
2. Open the corresponding prompt(s), customize variables, and apply them to your current project.
3. Iterate across stages to keep prompts aligned (requirements ↔ design ↔ implementation ↔ operations).

Over time, this bundle should be expanded with:
- Direct links to specific prompt files
- Recommended sequences and handoffs between stages
- Example end-to-end SDLC case studies using this library.
