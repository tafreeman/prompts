## 1. TL;DR

> **The harness is exposed via two adapters sharing one core: a typer CLI (`agentic-eval
> compare`) for scripting and CI use, and a FastAPI REST + WebSocket API for the React
> dashboard. Both call the same `Comparator.run()` method — hexagonal architecture with
> the application core decoupled from its entry points. WebSocket is chosen over SSE for
> real-time streaming because it reuses the proven `connectExecutionStream()` infrastructure
> already deployed in LivePage with zero new client code. Data contracts are Pydantic models
> with additive-only schema evolution.**

## 3. Context & Problem Statement

The `Comparator.run()` core (ADR-010) must be reachable from two distinct usage contexts
with fundamentally different requirements:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TWO INTERFACE CONTEXTS                                        │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CLI context (scripting / CI):                                 │
│    - Local terminal, bash scripts, scheduled CI pipelines      │
│    - Needs: inline args OR declarative YAML config file        │
│    - Output: file (HTML/MD report) + terminal summary          │
│    - Real-time: stdout progress lines, optional --quiet        │
│                                                                │
│  Web API context (React dashboard):                            │
│    - Browser-initiated async background job                    │
│    - Needs: REST POST to start, WebSocket for live progress    │
│    - Output: JSON (ComparisonResult) + downloadable reports    │
│    - Real-time: push events from server to client              │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The failure mode to avoid: building two separate evaluation pipelines. If CLI and API
contain duplicated evaluation logic, every bug requires two fixes and every new feature
requires two implementations. The solution is a single `Comparator.run()` core with two
thin adapter shells — hexagonal architecture (Cockburn, 2005).

### 3.1 Existing WebSocket Infrastructure

The project already has a battle-tested WebSocket pattern for real-time streaming:

```
api/websocket.ts:connectExecutionStream()
  - Auto-reconnects on disconnect (5 retries)
  - Exponential backoff: retryDelayMs * retryCount
  - Deployed and stable in LivePage.tsx since initial release

hooks/useWorkflowStream.ts
  - React hook mapping raw WebSocket events to typed state
  - Handles: workflow_start, step_start/end, evaluation_*, error
  - Proven in production for 30-60 minute workflow runs
```

Any new real-time feature must justify diverging from this infrastructure. The evaluation
harness has no such justification — its streaming requirements are identical: one-way server
→ client progress updates for a long-running asynchronous operation.

### 3.2 YAML Config Precedent — Promptfoo

Promptfoo (github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo) established the declarative YAML config as the
standard pattern for LLM A/B evaluation. Its configuration model — prompts, providers, and
test cases defined in YAML — enables reproducible, version-controlled evaluations. The
`eval.yaml` format adopted here borrows this declarative approach while adapting it to the
commit-driven use case (repo path, commit SHA, contestant definitions, rubric selection).

```

Alistair Cockburn's hexagonal architecture (2005, alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture)
states: "the goal is to allow an application to equally be driven by users, programs,
automated test or batch scripts, and to be developed and tested in isolation from its
eventual run-time devices." This is exactly the requirement: `Comparator.run()` must be
callable from both CLI and HTTP API without modification.

### 4.2 CLI Design (`cli.py`)

**Framework: typer** — built on top of click (the most widely adopted Python CLI library,
used by 38.7% of Python CLI projects as of 2025), typer adds Python type hint–driven
argument parsing with zero boilerplate. It auto-generates `--help` from function signatures,
provides shell auto-completion out of the box, and integrates natively with Pydantic models.

**Inline invocation:**
```bash
agentic-eval compare \
  --repo /path/to/repo \
  --commit abc123 \
  --contestant-a "workflow:code_review" \
  --contestant-b "prompt:prompts/experimental.md" \
  --rubric coding_standards \
  --output-format html \
  --output report.html
```

**Contestant type shorthand**: `"type:ref"` — parsed into `Contestant(type=type, ref=ref)`.

**Config file invocation** (declarative, version-controllable):
```bash
agentic-eval compare --config eval.yaml
```

```yaml
# eval.yaml
repo: /path/to/repo        # or https://github.com/owner/repo
commit: abc123
rubric: coding_standards   # or path to custom rubric.yaml
contestants:
  a:
    type: workflow
    ref: code_review
  b:
    type: prompt
    text: |                # inline prompt text — no file path needed
      You are an expert Python developer. Implement the following:
      {requirements}
    model: claude:claude-sonnet-4-6
    temperature: 0.3
output:
  format: html
  path: report.html
```

The YAML config enables eval runs to be pinned in the repository alongside the code they
evaluate — reproducible, auditable, committable.

### 4.3 REST + WebSocket API (`server/routes/eval.py`)

**Endpoints:**
```
POST /eval/compare          → { run_id: str }
GET  /eval/runs             → list[ComparisonRunSummary]
GET  /eval/runs/{run_id}    → ComparisonResult
WS   /ws/eval/{run_id}      → event stream (see §4.4)
```

**POST /eval/compare** body:
```json
{
  "repo": "/path/to/repo",
  "commit": "abc123",
  "rubric": "coding_standards",
  "contestants": {
    "a": { "label": "A", "type": "workflow", "ref": "code_review" },
    "b": { "label": "B", "type": "prompt",   "ref": null,
           "prompt_text": "You are...", "model": "claude:claude-sonnet-4-6",
           "temperature": 0.3 }
  }
}
```

The server starts `Comparator.run()` as a background task (FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`),
returns `run_id` immediately, and emits phase events over the WebSocket connection.

### 4.4 WebSocket Event Stream

```
client connects: ws://host/ws/eval/{run_id}
  ← { "type": "eval_start",  "run_id": "..." }
  ← { "type": "phase_start", "phase": "extract" }
  ← { "type": "phase_end",   "phase": "extract",  "status": "done", "elapsed_ms": 3200 }
  ← { "type": "phase_start", "phase": "run_a" }
  ← { "type": "phase_end",   "phase": "run_a",    "status": "done", "elapsed_ms": 47000 }
  ← { "type": "phase_start", "phase": "run_b" }
  ← { "type": "phase_end",   "phase": "run_b",    "status": "done", "elapsed_ms": 53000 }
  ← { "type": "phase_start", "phase": "score" }
  ← { "type": "phase_end",   "phase": "score",    "status": "done", "elapsed_ms": 8100 }
  ← { "type": "eval_complete", "winner": "A", "score_a": 7.8,
      "score_b": 6.4, "result": { ... ComparisonResult ... } }
```

**Minimal event vocabulary** — four event types (`phase_start`, `phase_end`,
`eval_complete`, `error`) — matches the granularity of the existing workflow event taxonomy
and avoids over-engineering the streaming protocol.

### 4.5 Data Contracts (Pydantic v2, additive-only)

**`Contestant`** — unified type with discriminator field (not three separate classes):
```python
class Contestant(BaseModel):
    label: str
    type: Literal["workflow", "prompt", "agent"]
    ref: str | None = None         # workflow name, file path, or agent class
    model: str | None = None       # model override
    prompt_text: str | None = None # type="prompt": inline text
    temperature: float = 0.7       # type="prompt": generation temperature
    system_prompt: str | None = None  # type="agent": system prompt override
```

**`ComparisonResult`** — additive-only, follows the `contracts/` project policy:
```python
class ComparisonResult(BaseModel):
    run_id: str
    task: TaskInstance
    trial_a: Trial
    trial_b: Trial
    score_a: dict[str, Any]     # EvaluationResult serialized
    score_b: dict[str, Any]
    rubric_score_a: float
    rubric_score_b: float
    patch_delta: str            # unified diff of patch_a vs patch_b
    winner: Literal["A", "B", "tie"]
    margin: float               # abs(score_a_weighted - score_b_weighted)
    created_at: str             # ISO 8601 timestamp
```

Schema evolution policy: fields are never removed or renamed. New optional fields are
added with defaults. This ensures stored run results remain readable as the harness
evolves — consistent with the `contracts/` additive-only convention.

## 5. Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `tools/commit_eval/cli.py` | New — typer CLI, inline args + YAML config |
| `tools/commit_eval/models.py` | New — `Contestant`, `ComparisonResult`, `Trial`, `TaskInstance` |
| `agentic_v2/server/routes/eval.py` | New — FastAPI router with POST/GET/WS endpoints |
| `agentic_v2/server/app.py` | Register eval router: `app.include_router(eval_router)` |
| `tools/pyproject.toml` | Add `typer>=0.12`, `pytest-json-report>=1.5` |

---

## 6. Rationale

### 6.1 typer over argparse and click

| Factor | typer | click | argparse |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Type hint-driven (no decorators per arg) | Yes | No — explicit `@click.option` per arg | No |
| Auto-generates `--help` from docstrings | Yes | Partial | Manual |
| Shell auto-completion | Built-in | Plugin (`click-completion`) | Manual |
| Pydantic model integration | Native | Manual serialization | Manual |
| Built on top of | click | — | stdlib |
| Lines of CLI code for this use case | ~100 | ~160 | ~200 |

typer is click with type hints. Since click is the most widely adopted Python CLI library
(38.7% of Python CLI projects as of 2025), typer inherits its stability and ecosystem while
reducing boilerplate by ~40% through type-hint inference. For a tool where the primary
users are developers who value discoverability (`--help`, auto-complete), typer is the
right choice.

### 6.2 WebSocket over SSE for Real-Time Streaming

| Factor | WebSocket | Server-Sent Events (SSE) |
|--------|-----------|--------------------------|
| Direction | Bidirectional (could support cancel) | Server → client only |
| Existing client infrastructure | `connectExecutionStream()` + `useWorkflowStream.ts` — proven, deployed | Would require new hook and reconnect logic |
| Auto-reconnect | Implemented in `connectExecutionStream()` (5 retries, exponential backoff) | Must implement from scratch |
| Binary data support | Yes | Text only |
| HTTP/2 multiplexing | Not native | Yes |
| Performance difference | Negligible for this use case — both are TCP push | Negligible |
| Protocol alignment with LivePage | Direct reuse | New divergent pattern |

The performance characteristics of WebSocket and SSE are similar for simple server-to-client
streaming (Ably Engineering, 2024; Timeplus benchmark, 2024). WebSocket is chosen here not
for inherent performance superiority but for **infrastructure reuse**: `connectExecutionStream()`
with its 5-retry exponential backoff has been running in production in LivePage without issues
for long-duration workflow runs. Creating a parallel SSE infrastructure would require:

1. A new browser EventSource reconnect wrapper
2. A new React hook
3. A new FastAPI streaming response handler
4. Parallel maintenance of two real-time patterns

This cost is unjustified when WebSocket covers the use case identically.

### 6.3 Unified `Contestant` Type vs. Three Separate Classes

A discriminated union with a `type: Literal[...]` field over three separate
`WorkflowContestant`, `PromptContestant`, `AgentContestant` classes because:

- The UI serializes a single JSON object to `POST /eval/compare` regardless of type
- The CLI YAML config has a single `contestants.a/b` shape regardless of type
- `ContestantRunner` dispatches on `contestant.type` — it does not need polymorphic dispatch
- Three separate classes create a union type (`WorkflowContestant | PromptContestant | AgentContestant`) everywhere downstream, doubling the annotation surface
- Optional fields with `None` defaults have no runtime cost

### 6.4 Additive-Only Schema Evolution

`ComparisonResult` follows the `contracts/` project policy established in the codebase.
Fields are never removed or renamed because:

1. Eval run results are stored as JSON files in the run store
2. The UI reads results from the API; older stored results must remain parseable
3. The CLI report renderer uses the same model; serialization must stay stable

New capabilities (e.g., adding `rubric_dimension_breakdown: list[dict] | None = None`)
can always be added as optional fields with `None` defaults without breaking existing
consumers.

### 6.5 Production Precedents for This Architecture

| System | Pattern | Analog in This ADR |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| **Temporal.io** | Workflow core (`Workflow`) + separate CLI + API SDKs | `Comparator.run()` + CLI adapter + REST adapter |
| **GitHub Actions** | REST API to start workflow + WebSocket log stream | `POST /eval/compare` + `WS /ws/eval/{id}` |
| **Promptfoo** | YAML config + CLI + optional server sharing the same eval core | `eval.yaml` format + `agentic-eval` CLI + FastAPI server |
| **Celery** | Worker core + beat scheduler + flower web UI as separate adapters | `Comparator` + CLI + web API |
| **Buildkite** | Sequential build steps with real-time log streaming to web | Sequential A→B execution + WebSocket phase events |

---

## 7. Consequences

### 7.1 Positive Outcomes

| Outcome | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| No duplicated evaluation logic | Single `Comparator.run()` core — CLI and API are thin adapters |
| CLI usable in CI without a running server | Direct Python import, no HTTP or WebSocket required |
| Real-time UI out of the box | Zero new WebSocket infrastructure — reuses existing `connectExecutionStream()` |
| Config file enables reproducible evals | `eval.yaml` pinned in repo alongside code being evaluated |
| Type-safe contracts at both boundaries | Pydantic models validated at CLI input and API request body |

### 7.2 Trade-offs and Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Long-running eval (30–120 min) needs persistent WebSocket | Medium | Server stores `ComparisonResult` to disk; client can poll `GET /eval/runs/{id}` if WS drops and doesn't reconnect within 5 retries |
| Run persistence across server restarts | Low | Store `ComparisonResult` as JSON in run store (consistent with existing workflow run storage) |
| Concurrent eval runs compete for worktree disk space | Low | Each run uses unique `/tmp/eval-{uuid}` path; auto-cleaned on completion |
| `prompt_text` field may contain sensitive prompt IP | Low | Never log full `Contestant` model; log only `label + type + ref` at INFO level |
| typer + Pydantic v2 compatibility | Low | Verified: typer 0.12+ supports Pydantic v2 model parameters natively |

---

## 8. Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Rejected Because |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **REST polling only (no WebSocket)** | Eval runs last 30–120 minutes; polling wastes requests and provides no real-time feedback; poor UX for long operations |
| **SSE instead of WebSocket** | Creates a second streaming protocol diverging from the proven `connectExecutionStream()` infrastructure; net cost with no benefit |
| **gRPC streaming** | Requires proto compilation; no browser-native support without gRPC-Web proxy; overkill for internal tool |
| **File-based IPC (tail a log file)** | No browser integration; requires filesystem access from client |
| **argparse for CLI** | Verbose boilerplate; poor help output; no Pydantic integration; `sys.argv` parsing |
| **click for CLI** | Equivalent capability to typer but 40% more code; typer builds on click — no reason to use click directly |
| **Three separate Contestant classes** | Union type annotations everywhere downstream; single discriminated union is strictly simpler |
| **Breaking schema changes in ComparisonResult** | Invalidates stored run history; violates `contracts/` additive-only policy |
