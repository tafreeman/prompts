# Scoring Rubrics for Multi-Agent Workflow Evaluation
# Each workflow has specific grading criteria with 1-10 numeric scores

version: "1.0.0"

# Score level descriptions (used across all rubrics)
# Each criterion is scored 1-10 with the following standard interpretation:
score_scale:
  10: "Exceptional - Exceeds all expectations, could serve as reference example"
  9: "Excellent - Meets all requirements with high quality, minor polish only"
  8: "Very Good - Fully meets requirements with good quality"
  7: "Good - Meets most requirements satisfactorily"
  6: "Satisfactory - Meets minimum requirements"
  5: "Adequate - Barely acceptable, notable gaps"
  4: "Below Average - Missing important elements"
  3: "Poor - Significant deficiencies"
  2: "Very Poor - Major failures, mostly non-functional"
  1: "Unacceptable - Does not meet any requirements"
