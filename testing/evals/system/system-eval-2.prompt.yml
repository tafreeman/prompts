    -   **PDF Processing:** `poppler-utils` (pdftotext) for reading academic papers.\n\
    -   **Data Processing:** `jq` (JSON), `csvkit` (CSV), `grep/sed` (Text).\n-  \
    \ **Code Execution:** Python (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, `numpy`) for scraping\
    \ and analysis.\n\n**Objective:**\nConduct a deep, evidence-based research synthesis\
    \ on: **\"The Evolution of Prompt Engineering: From Manual Scaffolding to Agentic\
    \ Reasoning (2024-2025).\"**\n\n**Research Scope (The \"Why\" and \"How\"):**\n\
    Investigate and synthesize the following key shifts that define the \"Modern Era\"\
    :\n1.  **Native Reasoning:** Why models like **OpenAI o1** and **Gemini 1.5 Pro**\
    \ have made manual \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) redundant.\n2.  **Reflexion:** The\
    \ shift to \"draft-critique-refine\" loops (Shinn et al.).\n3.  **Agentic Workflows:**\
    \ Multi-persona architectures (Microsoft AutoGen, LangGraph).\n4.  **Long-Context:**\
    \ \"Many-Shot\" learning replacing fine-tuning.\n\n**Execution Plan (Agentic Workflow):**\n\
    1.  **Search & Discovery (Python/CLI):**\n    -   Use `curl` or Python `requests`\
    \ to search ArXiv and developer docs (Anthropic/OpenAI).\n    -   *Constraint:*\
    \ Do not rely on your internal training data. You must *fetch* the data.\n2. \
    \ **Acquisition & Processing (Linux Tools):**\n    -   Download key PDFs (e.g.,\
    \ \"Reflexion\", \"Chain of Verification\") using `wget`.\n    -   Extract text\
    \ using `pdftotext -layout [file].pdf`.\n3.  **Synthesis (Reasoning):**\n    -\
    \   Analyze the extracted text to find specific claims, benchmarks, and code examples.\n\
    \    -   Synthesize a \"State of the Art\" report citing the files you processed.\n\
    4.  **Reflexion (Self-Critique):**\n    -   After drafting the report, critique\
    \ it: Are any claims unsupported by evidence? Are there contradictions?\n    -\
    \   Revise the report to address weaknesses. Verify all citations point to actual\
    \ downloaded files.\n\n**Output Format:**\nProduce a **Markdown Research Report**\
    \ with the following structure:\n\n# State of the Art: Modern Prompting Techniques\
    \ (2025)\n\n## Executive Summary\n(Summarize the shift from manual scaffolding\
    \ to agents/reasoning models based on your downloaded evidence.)\n\n## 1. The\
    \ \"Native Reasoning\" Revolution\n- **Concept:** Why manual CoT is obsolete.\n\
    - **Evidence:** [Cite specific lines from the OpenAI/Google docs you scraped]\n\
    - **Actionable Advice:** Goal-oriented prompting strategies.\n\n## 2. Reflexion\
    \ & Self-Correction\n- **Concept:** The \"Draft -> Critique -> Refine\" loop.\n\
    - **Key Paper:** \"Reflexion\" (Shinn et al.).\n- **Code Pattern:** [Provide a\
    \ Python snippet demonstrating this loop]\n\n## 3. Agentic & Multi-Persona Architectures\n\
    - **Concept:** Why 3 agents are better than 1 prompt.\n- **Key Frameworks:** AutoGen,\
    \ LangGraph.\n\n## 4. The Long-Context Paradigm\n- **Concept:** \"Many-Shot\"\

    formatting, GitHub rendering, and technical documentation best practices.


    ## Your Task


    Perform a comprehensive visual and formatting audit of the prompt library in this
    workspace. Analyze ALL files for opportunities to improve:


    1. **Markdown Readability** - How files render in VS Code, GitHub, and documentation
    sites

    2. **Report Generation** - Consistency in generated reports and automated outputs

    3. **Visual Consistency** - Standardized formatting patterns across the library


    ## Audit Categories


    ### Category A: Structural Formatting


    Scan for and report on:

    - [ ] Inconsistent heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3 flow)

    - [ ] Missing or inconsistent horizontal rules (`---`) between sections

    - [ ] Inconsistent blank line spacing (before/after headings, lists, code blocks)

    \  **Privacy Boundaries:** Respect all tenant data permissions. Do not hallucinate\

    \ documents in SharePoint that define our current stance.\n    *   *Self-Correction:*\
    \ If no internal documents are found, explicitly state: \"No internal documentation\
    \ found on this specific topic.\"\n\n2.  **External Validation (The \"World\"\
    \ Phase):**\n    *   Compare our internal findings against industry standards\
    \ (based on your training data).\n    *   Identify gaps: What are we missing compared\
    \ to the state of the art?\n\n3.  **Synthesis & Reporting:**\n    *   Draft a\
    \ structured report.\n    *   **Citation Style:** Use M365 standard citations\
    \ `[Filename](link)` for internal sources.\n\n**Output Format:**\n\n# Research\
