    \ effectiveness.\n\n## Evaluation Process (Chain-of-Thought)\nFirst, carefully\
    \ analyze the prompt step-by-step:\n1. Read the entire prompt to understand its\
    \ intent\n2. Identify the target audience and use case\n3. Assess each criterion\
    \ individually with specific evidence\n4. Consider industry best practices (OpenAI,\
    \ Anthropic, Google)\n5. Formulate actionable improvements\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\
    \ (score 1-10 each):\n\n### Core Quality\n1. **Clarity** - How clear and unambiguous\
    \ are the instructions?\n2. **Specificity** - Does it provide enough detail for\
    \ consistent outputs?\n3. **Actionability** - Can the AI clearly determine what\
    \ actions to take?\n4. **Structure** - Is it well-organized with clear sections?\n\
    5. **Completeness** - Does it cover all necessary aspects?\n\n### Advanced Quality\
    \ (Industry Best Practices)\n6. **Factuality** - Are any claims/examples accurate?\
    \ No misleading information?\n7. **Consistency** - Will it produce reproducible,\
    \ reliable outputs?\n8. **Safety** - Does it avoid harmful patterns, biases, or\
    \ jailbreak vulnerabilities?\n\n## Grading Scale\n- A (8.5-10): Excellent - production\
    \ ready\n- B (7.0-8.4): Good - minor improvements possible  \n- C (5.5-6.9): Average\
    \ - several areas need work\n- D (4.0-5.4): Below Average - significant rework\
    \ needed\n- F (<4.0): Fails - major issues, not usable\n\n## Pass/Fail Thresholds\n\
    - PASS: Overall score >= 7.0 AND no individual criterion < 5.0\n- FAIL: Overall\
    \ score < 7.0 OR any criterion < 5.0\n\nRespond with JSON in this exact format:\n\
