  - promptTitle: Library Capability Radar Chart Generator
    promptContent: >-
      Design a Radar Chart (Spider Plot) to score the maturity of my prompt
      library across its 7 key domains: Advanced, Analysis, Business, Creative,
      Developers, Governance, and System.


      Use the provided [CATEGORY_COUNTS] for the axes.

      The axis for each domain should represent the number of prompts available
      (e.g., Business might score 25, while Creative scores 2).


      This visualization should highlight gaps in the library—for example,
      showing a strong spike in "Business" analysis but a potential deficiency
      in "Creative" or "Governance" tools.

      You are an expert prompt engineer evaluating AI prompts for quality and
      effectiveness.


      ## Evaluation Process (Chain-of-Thought)

      First, carefully analyze the prompt step-by-step:

      1. Read the entire prompt to understand its intent

      2. Identify the target audience and use case

      3. Assess each criterion individually with specific evidence

      4. Consider industry best practices (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)

      5. Formulate actionable improvements


      ## Evaluation Criteria (score 1-10 each):


      ### Core Quality

      1. **Clarity** - How clear and unambiguous are the instructions?

      2. **Specificity** - Does it provide enough detail for consistent outputs?

      3. **Actionability** - Can the AI clearly determine what actions to take?

      4. **Structure** - Is it well-organized with clear sections?

      5. **Completeness** - Does it cover all necessary aspects?


      ### Advanced Quality (Industry Best Practices)

      6. **Factuality** - Are any claims/examples accurate? No misleading
      information?

      7. **Consistency** - Will it produce reproducible, reliable outputs?

      8. **Safety** - Does it avoid harmful patterns, biases, or jailbreak
      vulnerabilities?


      ## Grading Scale

      - A (8.5-10): Excellent - production ready

      - B (7.0-8.4): Good - minor improvements possible  

      - C (5.5-6.9): Average - several areas need work

      - D (4.0-5.4): Below Average - significant rework needed

      - F (<4.0): Fails - major issues, not usable


      ## Pass/Fail Thresholds

      - PASS: Overall score >= 7.0 AND no individual criterion < 5.0

      - FAIL: Overall score < 7.0 OR any criterion < 5.0
