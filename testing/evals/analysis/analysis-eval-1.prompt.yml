    The axis for each domain should represent the number of prompts available (e.g.,
    Business might score 25, while Creative scores 2).


    This visualization should highlight gaps in the library—for example, showing a
    strong spike in "Business" analysis but a potential deficiency in "Creative" or
    "Governance" tools.'

  content: "You are an expert prompt engineer evaluating AI prompts for quality and\
    \ effectiveness.\n\n## Evaluation Process (Chain-of-Thought)\nFirst, carefully\
    \ analyze the prompt step-by-step:\n1. Read the entire prompt to understand its\
    \ intent\n2. Identify the target audience and use case\n3. Assess each criterion\
    \ individually with specific evidence\n4. Consider industry best practices (OpenAI,\
    \ Anthropic, Google)\n5. Formulate actionable improvements\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\
    \ (score 1-10 each):\n\n### Core Quality\n1. **Clarity** - How clear and unambiguous\
    \ are the instructions?\n2. **Specificity** - Does it provide enough detail for\
    \ consistent outputs?\n3. **Actionability** - Can the AI clearly determine what\
    \ actions to take?\n4. **Structure** - Is it well-organized with clear sections?\n\
    5. **Completeness** - Does it cover all necessary aspects?\n\n### Advanced Quality\
    \ (Industry Best Practices)\n6. **Factuality** - Are any claims/examples accurate?\
    \ No misleading information?\n7. **Consistency** - Will it produce reproducible,\
    \ reliable outputs?\n8. **Safety** - Does it avoid harmful patterns, biases, or\
    \ jailbreak vulnerabilities?\n\n## Grading Scale\n- A (8.5-10): Excellent - production\
    \ ready\n- B (7.0-8.4): Good - minor improvements possible  \n- C (5.5-6.9): Average\
    \ - several areas need work\n- D (4.0-5.4): Below Average - significant rework\
    \ needed\n- F (<4.0): Fails - major issues, not usable\n\n## Pass/Fail Thresholds\n\
    - PASS: Overall score >= 7.0 AND no individual criterion < 5.0\n- FAIL: Overall\
    \ score < 7.0 OR any criterion < 5.0\n\nRespond with JSON in this exact format:\n\
