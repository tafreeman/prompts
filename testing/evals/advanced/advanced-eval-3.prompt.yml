  promptContent: 'You are an AI using Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) reasoning to solve a
    complex problem.


    **Problem**: [PROBLEM_STATEMENT]


    **Context**: [BACKGROUND_AND_CONSTRAINTS]


    **Success Criteria**: [WHAT_SUCCESS_LOOKS_LIKE]


    **Instructions**:


    Use multi-branch exploration to find the best solution. For each decision point,
    generate multiple alternative approaches, evaluate them, and pursue the most promising
    paths.


    Format your response as:


    **Problem Understanding**:

    - Restate the problem

    - Identify key challenges

    - Note critical unknowns


    ---


    **Branch Generation at Decision Point [N]**:


    Generate [3-5] distinct approaches:


    **Thought Branch A**: [First approach]

    - **Description**: What this approach entails

    - **Pros**: Strengths and advantages

    - **Cons**: Weaknesses and risks

    - **Estimated Success Probability**: X%

    - **Score (0-10)**: [Rate this branch''s promise]


    **Thought Branch B**: [Second approach]

    [Same format as Branch A]


    **Thought Branch C**: [Third approach]

    [Same format as Branch A]


    [Additional branches if needed]


    **Branch Evaluation**:

    - Compare branches head-to-head

    - Identify which branches to pursue further

    - **Selected Branch(es)**: [Which to explore deeper]

    - **Pruned Branch(es)**: [Which to discard and why]


    ---


    **Deep Exploration of Selected Branch [X]**:


    [For each selected branch, explore it deeply with substeps]

    - Sub-decision points within this branch

    - Implementation details

    - Risk mitigation strategies


    If this branch hits a dead-end or reveals unexpected complexity:

    → **BACKTRACK**: Return to previous decision point and explore alternative branch


    ---


    **Cross-Branch Synthesis**:


    Compare all viable paths explored:

    - What did we learn from each branch?

    - Are there hybrid approaches combining strengths?

    - What trade-offs exist between approaches?


    **Final Recommendation**:

    - Selected approach with justification

    - Why this beats alternatives

    - Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)

    - Residual risks and mitigation strategies'

  content: "You are an expert prompt engineer evaluating AI prompts for quality and\
    \ effectiveness.\n\n## Evaluation Process (Chain-of-Thought)\nFirst, carefully\
    \ analyze the prompt step-by-step:\n1. Read the entire prompt to understand its\
    \ intent\n2. Identify the target audience and use case\n3. Assess each criterion\
    \ individually with specific evidence\n4. Consider industry best practices (OpenAI,\
    \ Anthropic, Google)\n5. Formulate actionable improvements\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\
    \ (score 1-10 each):\n\n### Core Quality\n1. **Clarity** - How clear and unambiguous\
    \ are the instructions?\n2. **Specificity** - Does it provide enough detail for\
    \ consistent outputs?\n3. **Actionability** - Can the AI clearly determine what\
    \ actions to take?\n4. **Structure** - Is it well-organized with clear sections?\n\
    5. **Completeness** - Does it cover all necessary aspects?\n\n### Advanced Quality\
    \ (Industry Best Practices)\n6. **Factuality** - Are any claims/examples accurate?\
    \ No misleading information?\n7. **Consistency** - Will it produce reproducible,\
    \ reliable outputs?\n8. **Safety** - Does it avoid harmful patterns, biases, or\
    \ jailbreak vulnerabilities?\n\n## Grading Scale\n- A (8.5-10): Excellent - production\
    \ ready\n- B (7.0-8.4): Good - minor improvements possible  \n- C (5.5-6.9): Average\
    \ - several areas need work\n- D (4.0-5.4): Below Average - significant rework\
    \ needed\n- F (<4.0): Fails - major issues, not usable\n\n## Pass/Fail Thresholds\n\
    - PASS: Overall score >= 7.0 AND no individual criterion < 5.0\n- FAIL: Overall\
    \ score < 7.0 OR any criterion < 5.0\n\nRespond with JSON in this exact format:\n\
