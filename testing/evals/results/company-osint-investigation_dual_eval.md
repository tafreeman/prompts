## 📖 Methodology

This evaluation uses **Dual-Model Cross-Validation**:

1. **Multiple Models**: Each prompt evaluated by 5 different LLMs
2. **Multiple Runs**: 4 runs per model for statistical reliability
3. **Dual-Rubric System**: 8 criteria across Quality + Advanced dimensions
4. **Cross-Validation**: Score variance must be ≤ 1.5 between models
5. **Pass Threshold**: Overall ≥ 7.0/10 AND no criterion < 5.0

### Models Used

- `openai/gpt-4o-mini`
