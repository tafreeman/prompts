## [Unreleased]

### Documentation

- **Architecture umbrella + roadmap + honesty docs** (commit `41bd0d8`) — new `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` index linking the four existing `architecture-*.md` deep-dives (closes the broken `docs/README.md` reference); new `docs/ROADMAP.md` surfacing Epic 1/2/3/5/6 status, explicit Epic 4 tombstone, and proposed Epic 7 scope (closes the in-repo backlog gap flagged by the final review); new `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` documenting the 35 unresolved `agentic-v2-eval` mypy findings, the empty-window SLO trivial-pass, the schema-drift root-only blind spot, and the Python→TypeScript manual mirror; new `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` with first entries for the `presentation/` extraction, the `AgentProtocol.run` signature tightening, and the `langchain` adapter deprecation.
- **Epic retrospectives + three new ADRs** (commit `7b082fd`) — retrospective plan docs for Epics 3 (DevEx), 5 (UI Polish), and 6 (Eval Depth), covering stories, commits, load-bearing decisions, and process notes; **ADR-014** (Pydantic discriminated-union wire format for execution events), **ADR-015** (SLO rolling window stored in git as JSON artifacts — acknowledges the empty-window trivial-pass as open debt), **ADR-016** (GitHub Models via `GITHUB_TOKEN` as default E2E LLM provider — documents the zero-cost-vs-vendor-coupling trade-off); `ADR-INDEX.md` refreshed from 10 → 13 ADRs with updated lineage chains. Archive headers added to the Epic 1/2 prospective plan docs so unchecked boxes read as history rather than WIP.
- **Stale-artifact triage and count-drift fixes** (commit `205b314`) — deletes ~2,050 lines of orphaned content: `MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_{COMPLETE,PLAN,STATUS}.md`, `LANGCHAIN_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (directly contradicted ADR-013), `chatlg.md` (1052-line raw conversation log at `agentic-v2-eval/`), `playwright-tester-training-prompt.md`, and several `handoff.md` stubs. Count drift corrected in `ONBOARDING.md` / `GLOSSARY.md` / `CLAUDE.md` (24 → 7 agent personas, 78+ → 100+ test files, 10 → 6 workflow definitions). Corrected a factual claim in `docs/MIGRATIONS.md`: `presentation/` is not fully gone — the top-level directory retains leftover theme-collection scripts and raw-themes data pending a follow-up cleanup.
- **Post-v0.3.0 doc cleanup** (commit `e7c2a69`) — drops superseded `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `MASTER_MANIFEST.md`, and `docs/contribution-guide.md` (all replaced by newer artifacts landed during the doc overhaul); relocates `docs/eval-harness/*` planning artifacts to `planning-artifacts/eval-harness/` so the user-facing `docs/` tree only contains user-facing content; adds a ⚠️ STALE banner to `ACTIVE_VS_LEGACY_TOOLING_MAP.md` linking to current sources of truth rather than rewriting it blind.

### Cleanup & Refactoring

- **UI build artifacts untracked** (commit `9522baf`) — `agentic-workflows-v2/ui/dist/index.html` and `agentic-workflows-v2/ui/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` are now in `.gitignore`; they were showing up dirty after every `npm run build` and polluting every PR diff. Fulfills the spawned task filed during Sprint A triage.

### Stabilization (Sprint B)

- **SLO p95 empty-window trivial-pass fixed** (commit `c9c4f33`, Sprint B #2) — `readP95` in `agentic-workflows-v2/ui/e2e/slo-storage.ts` previously returned `0` on an empty rolling window, which silently satisfied the `<= 2000ms` assertion and produced a permanently green gate after any `slo-data` branch reset. Now throws a new `InsufficientDataError` when the window has fewer than `DEFAULT_MIN_SAMPLES` (= 10) records, and the Playwright spec converts that to `test.skip(...)` during bootstrap. Bootstrap semantics: deferred, not passed. From the 11th nightly onward the p95 budget is a hard gate.
- **All 35 `agentic-v2-eval` mypy findings cleared** (commit `ed78ee2`, Sprint B #1) — dropped `continue-on-error: true` from `.github/workflows/eval-package-ci.yml` in the same commit. Workstream breakdown: `types-PyYAML` added (2 errors), `_eval_one` refactored to a discriminated union `tuple[Literal[True], R] | tuple[Literal[False], Exception]` (6 errors across `runners/streaming.py`), optional-import guards via `_require_*_module()` helpers in `datasets.py` (6 union-attr + 1 no-any-return), 10 missing annotations added, 10 `no-any-return` fixes via typed locals. 241 tests still pass. One new `# type: ignore[return-value]` at `runners/streaming.py:199` documented with justification (`inspect.isawaitable` narrowing limitation).
- **Wire-format drift gate** (commit `ae3878c`, Sprint B #3) — new automated Python ↔ TypeScript mirror for `agentic_v2.contracts.events.ExecutionEvent`. `agentic_v2/contracts/events.py` is the source of truth; `scripts/generate_ts_types.py` emits `tests/schemas/events.schema.json`; `ui/scripts/generate-ts-types.mjs` uses `json-schema-to-typescript` to emit `ui/src/api/events.generated.ts`. New `wire-format-drift` CI job regenerates and fails the PR on mismatch. The migration caught three latent client-type mismatches (`status: StepStatus` vs. the wire `string`, non-nullable `input`/`output` that are actually nullable, `criteria` shape drift on `EvaluationCompleteEvent`), now coerced at the `useWorkflowStream.ts` boundary. Client-only transport events (`error`, `keepalive`, `connection_established`) live in a hand-defined `ChannelEvent` union since they are not in the Python contract. Contributor docs updated.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-22

First tracked release of the `agentic-workflows-v2` platform. Bundles
**Epic 1** (Platform Foundation), **Epic 2** (Observable Execution),
**Epic 3** (DevEx / Windows), **Epic 5** (Console UI Polish), and
**Epic 6** (Evaluation & Data Depth). See **Known Limitations** below
for items shipped with caveats and **Migration Notes** for breaking
changes vs. the prior unversioned state.

> **Note on Epic 4.** Epic numbering jumps from 3 to 5. Epic 4 was
> never authored in this repository — the number was skipped during
> planning. Not a regression, just a tombstone for the record.

### New Features

- **Epic 1 — Platform Foundation (agentic-workflows-v2)**
  - **Typed core protocols** — `AgentProtocol.run` no longer accepts/returns `Any`; signature tightened to `object` so type checkers stop treating agent I/O as opaque. Companion `ToolProtocol` conformance test added.
  - **Consolidated `Settings`** — All environment variable reads routed through a single typed `pydantic-settings` class; scattered `os.environ` lookups removed so misconfigured deployments fail fast at startup instead of deep inside a run.
  - **Adapter registry test isolation** — Autouse fixture resets the `AdapterRegistry` singleton between tests, eliminating cross-test leakage and flakes when suites register alternate engine backends.
  - **Schema-drift CI gate** — New snapshot test on `contracts/` Pydantic models fails the build on any unreviewed wire-format change; `scripts/generate_schemas.py` refreshes the canonical snapshot.
  - **OTEL parent-child trace assertion** — Regression test verifies the engine → agent span chain is preserved end-to-end so distributed traces remain connected in Jaeger / Tempo.
  - **Golden-output regression test** — Deterministic fixture locks the `code_review` workflow's final output; any behavioral drift in the native engine trips the test.
  - **CI lint + coverage enforcement** — Ruff runs as a required job and the 80% coverage floor is now enforced in GitHub Actions rather than advisory.
  - **MCP results cleanup** — Ruff `UP006` / `S324` fixes across `mcp/results` remove legacy typing forms and insecure hash defaults.

- **Epic 2 — Observable Execution (agentic-workflows-v2)**
  - **Typed execution-event wire format** — New `contracts/events.py` Pydantic discriminated union covers `workflow_start`, `step_start`, `step_end`, `step_complete`, `step_error`, `workflow_end`, and `evaluation_*`. WebSocket and SSE broadcasts validate before emit; client union in `ui/src/api/types.ts` stays in lockstep.
  - **Live DAG animation** — `@xyflow/react` nodes and edges animate through queued → running → complete / error states as events arrive on `/ws/execution/{run_id}`, so users can watch a run progress without opening server logs.
  - **StepNode B2 redesign** — Each node now renders an ASCII status chip, LLM tier pill, token counter, and a streaming-progress bar driven by live events.
  - **Step drill-down panel** — Click a node to see a five-field detail pane (inputs, outputs, status, timing, errors) that handles partial state gracefully while a step is still running.
  - **Playwright streaming PR gate** — New E2E job runs the streaming flow 5× per PR using `data-testid` hooks added across the UI; any single failure blocks merge.
  - **WebSocket reconnect-replay test** — Fault-injection E2E kills the socket mid-run and asserts the server's 500-event replay buffer restores UI state on reconnect.
  - **Time-to-first-span SLO + p95 gate** — New measurement test records first-span latency and fails the build if the p95 regresses past the contract.
  - **Nightly 50× reliability job** — Streaming E2E runs 50× on a nightly cron with a rolling flake-rate gate; reconnect and p95 contracts hardened alongside.

- **Epic 3 — DevEx / Windows (agentic-workflows-v2)**
  - **Windows bring-up hardening** — `scripts/setup-dev.ps1` one-command bootstrap validated in CI so a fresh Windows clone installs deps, validates workflows, and runs a smoke test without manual intervention.
  - **`port-guard` devex tool** — Detects and reports processes holding dev ports (8010 / 5173 / 6006) before server startup so conflicts surface with an actionable message instead of a cryptic bind error.
  - **`workspace-test-runner` tool** — Single entry point to run the right test suite for whichever package you're in (backend pytest, eval pytest, UI vitest).
  - **`workflow-linter` tool** — Validates YAML workflow definitions against the required-fields contract (`name`, `agent`, `description`, `depends_on`, `inputs`, `outputs`) before they reach the runtime.
  - **Windows Unicode CLI fix** — `agentic` CLI no longer crashes on the Windows default codepage when rendering non-ASCII output; CLI verification added to CI to prevent regressions.

- **Epic 6 — Evaluation & Data Depth (agentic-workflows-v2)**
  - **Contracts** — Additive Pydantic v2 models (`EvaluationCriterionDetail`, `ScoreLayersModel`, `HardGatesModel`, `FloorViolationModel`, `RunEvaluationDetail`, `DatasetSampleSummary`, …) mirrored as TypeScript interfaces in `ui/src/api/types.ts`; `EvaluationCompleteEvent` expanded with `passed`, `pass_threshold`, `criteria`.
  - **Tokens-30d stat** — `RunsSummaryResponse` gains `tokens_30d`; `run_logger.summary()` aggregates tokens across all runs started in the last 30 days; Dashboard live stat wired to real data.
  - **`GET /runs/{filename}/evaluation`** — Returns full rubric breakdown for any stored run, including criteria scores, score layers, hard gates, and floor violations.
  - **Dataset sample endpoints** — `GET /eval/datasets/sample-list?dataset_id=…&limit=…` and `GET /eval/datasets/sample-detail?dataset_id=…&sample_index=…`; dataset IDs use query params to handle slash characters.
  - **Evaluations page** — `EvaluationRubricAccordion` with lazy `[+]`/`[-]` expansion: criterion table (normalized %, ASCII progress bar, `[FLOOR]` badge), score layers, hard gate `[OK]`/`[FAIL]` rows, floor violation list.
  - **Datasets page** — 3-pane browser: dataset catalog → `SampleIndexGrid` (paginated `[<]`/`[>]`) → `DatasetDetailPane` (collapsible `[meta +/-]`, field rendering, JSON viewer, workflow preview badge).

- **Epic 5 — Console UI Polish (agentic-workflows-v2/ui)**
  - `StatusBadge` migrated to ASCII bracket format: `[OK ]` `[RUN]` `[ERR]` `[WARN]` using `--b-*` CSS tokens; works across dark / paper / bolt themes.
  - `useHotkeys` hook — global keyboard shortcuts (n / f / / / j / k / Esc) with input-focus guard and unmount cleanup.
  - Dashboard filter — `/` and `f` focus the filter input; `Esc` clears and blurs; narrows runs by workflow name or run ID.
  - State pages — `EmptyState` (`$ no <entity> yet`), `ErrorBanner` (`[!] {msg}`), `NotFoundPage` (404 terminal-style), `AppErrorBoundary` (React error boundary).
  - Skip-to-main link — visually hidden, appears on first Tab; `<main id="main-content">` as target.
  - Focus ring audit — `focus:ring-1 focus:ring-b-clay/50` added to all interactive elements; audit notes at `docs/a11y-focus-ring-audit.md`.
  - Paper theme contrast QA — `--b-text-dim` on `--b-bg1` verified at 7.45:1 (passes AA); bolt 5.92:1; dark 3.80:1 (dim tier, intentional).
  - `BDagMini` — pure SVG static DAG thumbnail; reuses `layoutDAG` (Kahn topological sort); linear chains render as vertical, parallel branches center-aligned per rank; themed via CSS vars.

- **`skill-architect` agent** — New AI persona specialized in designing, extracting, and refactoring skills as reusable prompt programs. Added to the canonical agent roster with full documentation.
- **`verify-and-correct` skill** — Bounded self-correction loop: automatically runs tests, lint, and type checks after code changes, then retries fixes (up to a limit) before reporting back. Reduces back-and-forth on build failures.
- **`session-plan` skill** — Plan a focused session with 1–2 goals, explicit success criteria, and a TODO checklist. Prevents mega-sessions that hit rate limits by scoping work upfront.
- **Headless prompts** — New infrastructure for running agent prompts without an interactive session.
- **Adapter registry CLI wiring (ADR-001)** — Orchestrator, workflow runner, and CLI now route through the adapter registry, making engine backends (native DAG, LangGraph) fully swappable at runtime.
- **SmartModelRouter hardening (ADR-002)** — Added persistence across restarts, `Retry-After` header support, and degraded-mode fallback so the router stays operational when providers are rate-limited or unavailable.

### Improvements

- **CI pipeline upgrades** — Updated `actions/setup-python` from v4 → v5 across all workflows. Added cross-package E2E job, expanded security scanning with `pip-audit`, and tightened dependency review to fail on severity `moderate`.
- **Release pipeline** — New tag-triggered `deploy.yml` with build provenance for reproducible releases.
- **Performance regression detection** — Rewrote `performance-benchmark.yml` to compare against a stored baseline and fail on detected regressions.
- **Secret sanitization rule** — Always-on sanitization middleware now redacts API keys, tokens, and passwords before they reach LLM context. Covers all agent sessions by default.
- **Backlog tracking** — Added 11 new backlog tickets (rows 34–44) covering architectural debt, test gaps, and documentation tasks.

### Security

- **P0 tool-layer hardening** — `http_ops`, `search_ops`, and `shell_ops` received critical security fixes: SSRF URL validation, shell injection blocklist (20+ blocked patterns), `shlex.split` with `shell=False`, path traversal guards, and `__builtins__` restriction in the code execution sandbox.

### Bug Fixes & Documentation

- Fixed factual drift across monorepo documentation (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README files, ADRs).
- Corrected 40+ dangling references to deleted prompts and removed workflows.
- Removed 23 duplicate tests, fixed 2 broken tests as part of ADR-008 test coverage overhaul.
- Aligned stale agent config entries with the current agent roster.

### Test Coverage (ADR-008)

- Added tests for 12+ previously untested modules, including evaluation pipeline, workflow pipeline, server backends, LLM judge, and scoring.
- Hardened server test coverage for streaming backends and session handling.
- Overall test coverage for `agentic_v2` raised toward the 80% target.

### Cleanup & Refactoring

- **Presentation system extracted** — The presentation/deck builder has been moved to its own standalone repository (`present`). 245 files removed from this repo; raw-themes data and scripts are preserved in the new repo.
- Removed deprecated agent prompts, workflow definitions, Copilot config, and stale GitHub Actions workflows.
- Removed dead prompt constants, obsolete artifact files, and cleaned up `.gitignore`.

### Migration Notes

- **`presentation/` system extracted to a standalone repo (`present`).** If you imported anything from `presentation/*` or ran its deck-builder / token-generation scripts, those paths no longer exist here. 245 files moved.
  - **What moved:** brutalist deck builder, JSX + PPTX slide generators, theme registry, raw-theme token configs, Storybook catalog, and the accompanying test suite.
  - **What stayed:** `decks-generated/` (the output artifacts from the old builder) remains in this repo until downstream consumers migrate.
  - **Action required:** Update imports of `presentation.*` or `src/tokens/*` to point at the new `present` repo, OR pin a pre-2026-04 commit of this repo if you are not ready to migrate.
- **`agentic_v2.core.protocols.AgentProtocol.run` signature tightened** from `Any` to `object`. Code that relied on implicit-`Any` call sites may now surface previously hidden `mypy` errors; update call sites to use the bounded `TypeVar`s (`TInput` / `TOutput`) from `agentic_v2.agents.base`.
- **`langchain` adapter is deprecated** in favor of the native DAG engine (see ADR-013). Importing `agentic_v2.langchain.*` still works but emits a `DeprecationWarning`. Plan to migrate off before v0.5.0.

### Known Limitations

This release ships with the following known issues. All are tracked for Sprint B or later; none block the primary workflows documented in `docs/ONBOARDING.md`.

- **35 mypy findings in `agentic-v2-eval/`** are now visible in CI (`continue-on-error: true`, not blocking merges). One of them (`agentic_v2_eval/runners/streaming.py:216-235`) raises an object that is not derived from `BaseException` and is a real bug worth fixing in Sprint B. Tracked as "Sprint B #7-followup" in `eval-package-ci.yml`.
- **SLO p95 gate can pass trivially on empty data.** `readP95({ windowDays: 7 })` in `ui/e2e/slo-storage.ts` returns `0` when the rolling window has no records, which silently satisfies the `<= 2000ms` assertion. Mitigated by the nightly workflow appending one sample per run, but the first night after an `slo-data` branch reset is a free pass.
- **Schema-drift guard is root-properties-only.** `tests/test_schema_drift.py` checks the top-level `properties` of covered Pydantic models; field removals on nested models referenced via `$defs`, as well as any type narrowing (e.g., `str` -> `Literal[...]`), pass silently. Tracked for extension in Sprint B.
- **No true placeholder / no-LLM mode.** Both local runs and CI require at least one configured LLM provider. In CI we use `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `models: read` to reach GitHub Models (zero-cost on public repos). The Epic 2 plan referenced a placeholder toggle, but the toggle was not implemented. See ADR-016 (planned) for the rationale.
- **Python -> TypeScript wire-format mirror is manual.** `agentic_v2/contracts/events.py` is hand-mirrored in `ui/src/api/types.ts`; there is no codegen or drift-detection gate. An intentional schema change must be made in both files; a missed edit ships as a silent frontend bug.
- **UI build artifacts are git-tracked.** `agentic-workflows-v2/ui/dist/index.html` and `agentic-workflows-v2/ui/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` are historical tracked files that re-dirty after every `npm run build`. A follow-up task is filed; expect `git status` noise after building the UI locally.
