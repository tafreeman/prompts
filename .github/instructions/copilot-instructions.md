# GitHub Copilot instructions (compatibility pointer)

This repo now uses a standard targeted instructions file:

- `.github/instructions/prompts-repo.instructions.md`

And the canonical repo map + commands live in:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

If you’re seeing this file referenced by older docs/config, use the two files above.
