# Archive

This folder stores preserved evaluation outputs, research artifacts, and temporary files that were moved from the repository root during cleanup.

## Contents

### outputs/
Evaluation runs, test results, and temporary analysis artifacts. These files are generated by evaluation tooling and can be regenerated.

**Retention policy**: Keep for historical reference but can be deleted after 90 days or when no longer needed for analysis.

## Archived Items

- **Evaluation artifacts**: `batch_eval_results.json`, `tmp_*.json`, `probe_results.json`
- **Test outputs**: `test_results*.txt`, `pytest_output.txt`, `test_errors.txt`
- **ToT outputs**: `tot_*_output.txt`
- **Model discovery**: `gh_models_list.json`, `model_discovery.json`
- **Documentation exports**: Duplicate HTML/PDF/PNG/JPEG exports of Evaluation Agent Guide (canonical markdown remains at `tools/archive/EVALUATION_AGENT_GUIDE.md`)

## Regenerating Artifacts

Most artifacts can be regenerated using:
- `tools/batch_free_eval.py` for evaluation results
- `python -m pytest testing/` for test outputs
- `tools/model_probe.py` for model discovery

## Safe to Delete?
