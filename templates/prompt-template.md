# Prompt Title Here

## Description

Provide a clear, concise description of what this prompt does and its primary purpose. Explain the problem it solves or the task it accomplishes.

## Goal

State the primary goal of this prompt in one or two sentences. What is the user ultimately trying to achieve?

## Context

Describe the background information or situation the AI should assume. Include relevant domain, audience, systems, or business constraints.

## Inputs

List the inputs the user must provide (e.g., documents, code snippets, metrics, requirements). Use clear placeholders like `[PRODUCT_NAME]`, `[TEAM_NAME]`, `[RISK_LEVEL]`.

## Assumptions

Call out any assumptions the AI should make (or avoid) when information is missing or ambiguous.

## Constraints

Specify hard constraints such as length limits, tone requirements, compliance boundaries, performance/cost constraints, or technologies that must/must-not be used.

## Process / Reasoning Style

Describe how the AI should think (e.g., direct answer, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, ReAct, reflection/self-critique) and whether reasoning should be visible in the final answer.

## Output Requirements

Define the expected output format and structure (e.g., Markdown sections, bullet lists, tables, JSON/YAML schema). Note any delimiters or tags required for automation.

## Use Cases

List 3-5 specific scenarios where this prompt would be useful:

- Use case 1: Describe when and why someone would use this
- Use case 2: Another practical application
- Use case 3: A third example scenario
- Use case 4: (Optional) Additional scenario
- Use case 5: (Optional) Another scenario

## Prompt

```text
[Write your actual prompt here. Be specific, clear, and provide all necessary context.
Include any instructions, constraints, or format requirements.

Use [brackets] to indicate variables that users should replace with their own values.

Recommended structure (adjust as needed):
- Role / persona definition
- Goal
- Context and inputs
- Assumptions and constraints
- Process / reasoning style (e.g., step-by-step, multi-branch)
- Output requirements and format (including any delimiters/tags)]
```

## Variables

Explain what each variable in your prompt means and what users should replace it with:

- `[variable_name_1]`: Clear explanation of what to put here
- `[variable_name_2]`: Another variable description
- `[variable_name_3]`: What this variable represents

## Example Usage

**Input:**

```text
Show a concrete example of your prompt with real values filled in.
This helps users understand how to actually use the prompt.
```

**Output:**

```text
Provide an example of what the AI would generate or respond with.
This sets expectations for users about what they should receive.
```
