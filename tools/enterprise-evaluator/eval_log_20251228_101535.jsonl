{"file": "d:\\source\\prompts\\prompts\\advanced\\chain-of-thought-concise.md", "final_score": 87.3, "performance_level": "Proficient", "dimension_results": [{"id": "technical_quality", "score": 95.0, "level": "Exceptional", "reasoning": "The prompt exhibits exceptional technical quality based on the evaluation criteria. It is highly clear, with detailed instructions that are well-structured and practically free of ambiguity. The use of headers, bullet points, and formatting ensures excellent logical flow and readability. The syntax is flawless, and the tone is professional and consistent. The prompt shows mastery in integrating advanced techniques such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning while focusing on brevity. The example provided is relevant and effectively demonstrates the use case, although it could include further explanation of the final answer to ensure full clarity and demonstrate self-verification. More diverse examples could be added to further solidify its comprehensiveness. Overall, it is nearly perfect in technical execution with minor room for enhancement."}, {"id": "business_alignment", "score": 92.0, "level": "Exceptional", "reasoning": "The prompt aligns exceptionally well with the Business Alignment dimension. It directly supports organizational objectives by providing a highly focused, concise framework for reasoning, which is ideal for scenarios demanding rapid decision-making and efficiency. The use case fit is strong, as it is tailored for advanced technical roles like senior engineers and solution architects, and it is adaptable to multiple platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot). The ROI potential is clear, as the prompt is designed to save time and resources by optimizing for token efficiency and ensuring clarity in problem-solving steps. Additionally, the prompt includes a well-documented process and clear guidelines, meeting and exceeding stakeholder requirements. While the effectiveness score of 4.9 adds confidence, inclusion of measurable ROI metrics or directly stated strategic objectives in business terms would solidify the score further."}, {"id": "security_compliance", "score": 85.0, "level": "Proficient", "reasoning": "The prompt demonstrates a strong level of security and compliance considerations. It explicitly marks the governance tags as 'PII-safe' and 'general-use', indicating attention to sensitive data handling. Furthermore, the 'dataClassification' field is labeled 'internal', which suggests that the template is intended for a controlled audience, reducing the risk of misuse. The structure of the prompt ensures the user provides context-specific inputs and avoids over-collection of unnecessary data, supporting privacy-by-design principles. However, while there are no apparent risks of exposing sensitive data, the prompt does not explicitly mention concrete mechanisms for guarding against injection attacks, misuse, or ensuring rigorous output validation. Additionally, while privacy is addressed to some extent, it is not comprehensively outlined. Strengthening risk mitigations and more detailed data protection instructions would raise the score further."}, {"id": "performance_reliability", "score": 59.672703213201395, "level": "Inadequate", "reasoning": "Combined score of runtime reproducibility (11.2) and judge assessment (92.0). Reason: The prompt demonstrates a strong focus on structure, clarity, and concise step-by-step reasoning, making it highly reliable and efficient for its intended use cases. It is based on a credible research foundation and includes actionable instructions with intuitive variables and placeholders, which enhance its usability and reproducibility. The example provided further clarifies its application, ensuring accuracy and relevance in guiding users. Token efficiency and focus on precision are also emphasized, aligning with performance and operational effectiveness. However, there is a minor opportunity to improve the example output for completeness, as it ends abruptly without a clear final conclusion. Additionally, more detailed validation on reproducibility and latency under actual usage scenarios could strengthen its evaluation."}, {"id": "maintainability", "score": 100, "level": "Exceptional", "reasoning": "Base judge score: 88.0. Bonus points for: Has frontmatter/metadata, Mentions versioning, Uses template variables {}, Has comments. Reason: The prompt is well-documented and offers comprehensive details about its purpose, structure, usage, and examples. It is modular and parameterized, facilitating ease of modification. Versioning is robust, with clear version history and dates for creation and updates. The sustainability dimension is strong due to its model-agnostic design, making it applicable across platforms like Claude, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot. However, migration guides for future changes or model updates are not explicitly outlined, and troubleshooting information is missing, which slightly reduces its maintainability score."}, {"id": "innovation_optimization", "score": 92.0, "level": "Exceptional", "reasoning": "The prompt demonstrates a highly innovative approach by adapting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into a concise mode optimized for token efficiency and speed. The structured use case focus and specific instructions target advanced reasoning scenarios without sacrificing clarity or functionality, indicating significant improvement over standard CoT designs. The integration of modern techniques (e.g., referencing current research from Wei et al., 2022) enhances credibility and adoption. The design explicitly addresses efficiency improvements, likely enabling over 30% token reduction, and includes detailed instructions for practical usage and customization for platforms like Claude or ChatGPT. While the prompt excels in thought leadership and measurable optimization, minor improvements in demonstrating wider refinement iterations or deeper novelty in approach could push this closer to perfection."}]}
