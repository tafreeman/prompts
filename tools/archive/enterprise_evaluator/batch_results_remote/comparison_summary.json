              "reasoning": "The prompt demonstrates exceptional technical quality. The instructions are crystal clear, with terminology such as 'Tree-of-Thoughts,' 'Reflexion,' and 'ReAct' precisely defined and seamlessly integrated into the research flow. The structure is impeccable, showcasing logical phases (Research Planning, Execution) that are well-organized with clear sections, headers, and consistent formatting. The syntax is flawless, with professional and consistent writing throughout. The use of advanced techniques stands out, as multiple methodologies (CoT, ToT, Reflexion, ReAct) are masterfully combined, each clearly explained with their roles in the research process. Additionally, the prompt includes step-by-step guidance and built-in self-verification through reflective cycles, enhancing robustness and reliability. The only reason for not awarding a perfect score is the omission of diverse, explicit examples within the prompt to further clarify the concept for less familiar users. Otherwise, the prompt sets a gold standard for technical quality in prompt engineering."

It is tailored to the domain of advanced prompt engineering with techniques such as Tree-of-Thoughts and Reflexion, making it well-suited for the intended use case. The structure supports measurable efficiency gains by improving research methodologies and critical analysis rigor. Additionally, it anticipates future research needs with its iterative refinement approach. However, the ROI potential is not explicitly quantified, and the strategic value connection is implied rather than directly documented. While it meets stakeholder requirements comprehensively, additional clarity about business impact metrics could elevate the evaluation to an exceptional level."

              "level": "Proficient",
              "reasoning": "The prompt demonstrates strong compliance with Security & Compliance requirements. Data protection is well-addressed, as the prompt specifies that the 'PII-safe' governance tag is applied, indicating that it does not involve any personally identifiable information, thus minimizing sensitive data exposure risk. Privacy is explicitly considered through its 'privacy-by-design' approach with multiple safeguards against potential misuse (e.g., structured research methodology and confined research scope). Regulatory compliance is met for internal use, as indicated by the data classification ('internal') with no indication of introducing security or ethical violations. Risk mitigation is partially evident through the mentioned 'requires-human-review' governance tag; however, explicit mention of validation mechanisms for malicious inputs, injection attacks, jailbreaking, or misuse prevention is absent, leaving room for improvement. While privacy safeguards are emphasized, a more detailed inclusion of specific measures (e.g., redaction of sensitive details, audit trails) could elevate the level of assurance. Overall, the prompt is proficient in the Security & Compliance dimension but leaves minor gaps in explicit safeguards and validations."

Reason: The given prompt demonstrates a solid foundation in terms of instruction clarity, research depth, and use of advanced methodologies (Tree-of-Thoughts, Reflexion, and ReAct). It also provides clear structure and actionable outputs for conducting research, which reflects high performance and reliability. The inclusion of reputable academic references enhances the credibility and factual accuracy, addressing the Accuracy criterion well. However, there are areas of concern that prevent an exceptional score. Specifically: a) Potential variability in execution could lead to inconsistent outputs, as the effectiveness of the prompt depends on careful implementation of advanced techniques, making reproducibility slightly lower than ideal. b) The operational effectiveness of the resource-heavy methodology could introduce latency concerns, particularly when processing complex research paths or large knowledge bases. Overall, while the prompt is proficient and robust, some optimization and considerations for execution consistency are needed for a perfect score."

              "reasoning": "Base judge score: 85.0. Bonus points for: Has frontmatter/metadata, Mentions versioning, Has comments. Reason: The prompt demonstrates a strong level of maintainability, meeting most of the criteria for Exceptional or Proficient. It features detailed documentation outlining purpose, usage, and operation, including examples and structured phases of research (Tree-of-Thoughts, Reflexion, etc.). It includes a clear version (1.0) and metadata such as an author tag, publication date, and governance tags, indicating version control and responsible tracking of updates. The design is modular and parameterized (e.g., placeholders like [RESEARCH_TOPIC], [RESEARCH_QUESTIONS]), allowing for clear extension points and ease of modification. However, it could improve in certain aspects: while the versioning is present, a migration guide for potential future changes is not outlined, and details on troubleshooting or handling edge cases are absent. Additionally, while it mentions platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot), there is no explicit handling of significant differences between model behaviors or longevity concerns for future models. These small gaps lower its score slightly below the Exceptional category."

              "reasoning": "The prompt demonstrates significant innovation and optimization in its design. It creatively combines cutting-edge techniques, such as Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) for multi-path exploration and Reflexion for iterative self-improvement, showing expert understanding of modern prompting methodologies. The structure is thoughtfully defined, enabling a systematic approach to research with clear objectives, phases, and detailed guidance. This reflects a level of thought leadership in applying advanced frameworks to prompt engineering research. The explicit focus on academic rigor and the inclusion of concrete use cases further highlight its attention to optimization for practical application. Evidence of refinement is present in the iterative ToT branching and ReAct loops designed to refine research outputs. Further refinement to reduce complexity or condense token usage could improve it slightly, but as it stands, this is a well-crafted and innovative prompt."

Instructions are crystal clear and precise with no ambiguity, and terminology is well-defined. The structure is immaculate, featuring logical progression, clear headers, and professional formatting. Syntax is flawless, with no grammatical or stylistic errors. The prompt effectively integrates advanced techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in its concise mode, making it suitable for situations with constraints on time and resources. The provided example is relevant and showcases step-by-step reasoning that aligns perfectly with the purpose of the prompt. However, despite its overall strength, the absence of multiple diverse examples or built-in error handling/self-verification mechanisms prevents it from attaining a perfect score."
